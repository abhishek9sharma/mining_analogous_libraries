the best way is not to write any initializing statements
this is because if you write
then by default in java all the values of array i.e
and are initialized to 0
regarding the local variable hiding a field post your entire code for us to come to conclusion
this is untested but i think it will work
the main idea is to iterate the segment and sample lists once producing a group of samples for each segment
then for each of those groups you generate the hours and minutes and a summary item for each combination
finally you calculate the average speed of all non-zero samples in the hour minute combination
this isn t quite ideal because you still iterate the segment s samples 24 4 times but it is much better than iterating the entire sample list
this should get you on the right path and hopefully you can optimize that last bit further
from what i understand from the examples and the source you need to name the id of the div where you set up your rating component such that it should be something like x_y
where x is the proportion of rating that you want to give
for example if you want to have total 5 stars length 5 in your system
examples
if you want a default rating of 2.5 then x would be 10 as 5 10 20 2.5
the id of that div could be named as 10_2
if you want a rating of 4 then x would be 16 as 5 16 20 4
the id of that div could be named as 16_5
the score is calculated from 20
number of stars is configurable
you may fetch the data in whichever manner you please to however while creating the divs for rating you will have to follow this naming convention to use this plugin from what i understand
try this approach
have a look on setproctitle package
this is quite a portable version and works on many platforms
how do i convert a clojure map into string almost key value pair as shown below
clojure data
i want to convert the above to
i don t want any identifiers delimiters between but obviously starks should always be followed by winter is coming
i tried this
which outputs this
which is not what i want at all.
the map data keys and values are not always the same so it needs to be generic
there will always be just one level as in the value will not contain a nested map etc
edit
what i m actually trying to do
i am trying to index a few thousand neo4j nodes with clojure
to help me with this task i am using neocons clojure neo4j library
according to the documentation the add-to-index accepts properties and values like so
which is in my above case going to look like
now i have my node i can access the node properties with data node and that gives me a clojure map
the property differs pretty much from node to node so i m trying to figure out how to pass that map to the library in the way that it understands
marius danila s answer got me almost there
doing
still complains of the third parameter as it has the braces around the result
so how can i achieve this
do i just have to write a whole lot of if-not blocks to construct the properties myself
thanks
i have a drop-down list in my jsp and using spring mvc the problem i am facing is on form submission the value in the drop-down gets change to the default value
i have binded this drop-down list as shown below--

objectb contains primitive type property id
i am using ajax to send post request to controller

i ended up overriding opensessioninviewfilter with custom implementation
1
web.xml
contextloaderlistener is required for spring to work
autoflushopensessioninviewfilter is applied to intercept requests from the url pattern
2
autoflushopensessioninviewfilter
opensessioninviewfilter is the default way to intercept hibernate sessions
the opensession method opens a hibernate session
hibernate would use this session instead of creating a new one
hibernate3.support.opensessioninviewfilter allows you to provide a flushmode hibernate4.support.opensessioninviewfilter hard codes the value so i override it with my own implementation
make sure your sessionfactory bean name is sessionfactory
otherwise you need to set the sessionfactorybeanname as a filter init-param in web.xml
3
all the spring beans need to be registered within the web application context web.xml
4
make sure you get your spring beans only from the application context when you need to use them
the following is a how to example
make sure there is only one copy of the spring beans being created
if you use org.springframework.context.support.classpathxmlapplicationcontext to load spring beans these beans would not be picked up by the filter
5
in my case a contextid is also required
otherwise i get the issue below
if anyone is interested the following is what s in my ivy.xml
hope this helps anyone who comes across the same issue when upgrading spring and hibernate
i need to be able to provide a url that when clicked points to this page

the openmp 4.0 specification was finalised and published one year ago

i m trying to add objects to an array so they list as this desired structure
but they re being added as
this is the code used for the 2nd array
my array contains everything i want without error just in the wrong structure
an example of my current structure is here
i m basically just trying to add the myobjects to the parent but instead they re being added to their own parent object
how can i add them so they appear as in the desired structure
assuming the existence of push as below you can use the recv_stack and send_stack function as below
error report is rudimentary but it is structured so that it is easy to improve on it

i would go with meagar to have a css and a javascript file
however if you really want to get it through javascript you can add a async get call like .get and handle the response as your new string
ugly hum
yet another option is to generate the css output and put it manually in your javascript or better yet loading it in your coffeescript file like this
exemple from coffescript.org
time zone handling
i just want to clarify even though this has been commented so future people don t miss this very important distinction
displays a return value in utc and requires the seconds to be a string and outputs a utc time object whereas
displays a return value in the local time zone normally requires a fixnum argument and returns a time object in the local time zone
so even though i passed the same integer to both methods i seemingly two different results because of how the class #to_s method works
however as eero had to remind me twice of
an equality comparison between the two return values still returns true
again this is because the values are basically the same although different class s the method takes care of this for you but the #to_s method prints drastically different strings
although if we look at the strings we can see they are indeed the same time just printed in different time zones
method argument clarification
the docs also say if a numeric argument is given the result is in local time. which makes sense but was a little confusing to me because they don t give any examples of non-integer arguments in the docs
so for some non-integer argument examples
you can t use a string argument but you can use a time argument into time.at and it will return the result in the time zone of the argument

you need to modify your code like this
html after footer comments your html code must be like this
css
1 added class drop-display
2 removed 1 drop-down-menu class as was repeating and modified one
jquery
1 added line to hide drop-down-menu on page load
2 modified code of visibility to fadein or fadetoggle
i am very sure this will work if still any issue feel free to ask
update
html - added one more ul and onclick event
css - removed text-align center line and changed position relative to absolute
jquery - total change
plz give the size of the columns with varchar too
such as varchar 20
define error as a global variable
that is remove varbefore using the variable
save your image to a .tar
transfer it to your windows machine and load it
say i have a 16 bit greyscale image of 2 x 2 pixels that are perfectly random
the information content is 2 x 2 x 2 bytes 8 byte
next i bilinear interpolate 8 x 8 time pixels in between my 2 x 2 initial pixels that now form the border
for each pixel i look up a 3 byte rgb value from a rainbow colormap
if i were to store this image uncompressed it would now take 10 x 10 x 3 bytes 300 bytes
however the information content has not increased by much
a super intelligent compression algorithm should be able to look at my 100 pixels and deduce what i have done and store the initial 2 x 2 greyscale pixels + a color map
which compressed existing image format should i use for storing such an image
you can read the source for arraylist here source
and you are right it keeps an array and replaces it as needed to allow room for more objects
but it also stores the length so the array can be longer than is needed
that allows the arraylist to grow a little without having to re-create the actual array everytime
if the arraylist gets smaller it doesn t have to re-create
it just changes the length as stored
you can read the code to see how they decide when to change the array itself
whenever they do that they have to copy the old one s contents over
you are right btw that the old arrays get garbage collected as long as there are not variables referencing them
it sort of depends on how your code works
if that code you show and the definition is the only reference then it will get gc ed when you make a new array and store it

deviceready is a special cordova event
unless you launch your code in a cordova environment the event will never get fired and your code will never get executed
you can run cordova in the browser by adding the browser as a platform
for more info see
you could also use something like ripple to emulate the cordova environment in chrome
here are a few ideas
1
penalized optimization
you could round the arguments of the objective function
and add a penalty for non-integers
but this creates a lot of local extrema
so you may prefer a more robust optimization routine
e.g. differential evolution or particle swarm optimization
2
exhaustive search
if the search space is small you can also use a grid search
3
local search with user-specified neighbourhoods
without tweaking the objective function you could use some form of local search
in which you can specify which points to examine
this should be much faster but is extremely sensitive to the choice of the neighbourhood function
4
tabu search
to avoid exploring the same points again and again you can use
tabu search
i.e. remember the last k points to avoid visiting them again
in the following example it does not really work
we only move to the nearest local minimum
and in higher dimensions things get even worse
the neighbourhood is so large that we never hit the cache
of already visited points
differential evolution works better we only get a local minimum
but it is better than the nearest one
tabu search is often used for purely combinatorial problems
e.g. when the search space is a set of trees or graphs
and does not seem to be a great idea for integer problems
add px to every height value

html5 in itself do not have any support for secure connections
you can stream video and anything else over a https ssl-encrypted connection
nothing in your browser outside this is secure in any sense though nowadays ssl seem to loose grips too...
webrtc official page see here for webrtc draft will support encryption on connection but currently this technology is relative experimental and unstable but available in both chrome and firefox normal versions
that being said for webrtc to be able to negotiate peers securely this negotiation need also to happen on an encrypted connection which mean you would need ssl in any case as the direct connection is not established at this point
my advice would be to keep it simple and stream video the traditional way with a ssl connection

you can simply reference the queue-channel in one of your serviceactivator and do whatever you want with the messages

one of the most notable disatvantage of chosen approach is a significant burden placed on the developer the abstraction layer

btw you ve already did a mistake there attempting to return new adapternode node- firstchild from node getfirstchild method if the first child is an element you ll be unable to cast adapternode into adapterelement
there is also performance and memory overhead probably limiting reusability as well as tying to a particular xml library
i ve thaught of something like making node and also element text etc. itself a smart-pointer for the underlying implementation
e.g.
surely it makes sense to add inline wrappers for appropriate methods from xmlapi to node element and text but it s just a minor implementation detail
main advantage here is far less overhead it s still there e.g
converting strings to char const and making an implementation for particular xml library is much more straightforward
you just unpack low-level node pointer pass it to low-level api and pack the result
no almost no see strings conversion memory management or complicated inheritance hierarchies
implementations of node element and other classes are fixed and should be written only once and the only changing part is xmlapi
upd if you can make your library a header-only with templates you can even elminate all virtual methods calls overhead by turning xmlapi into a template parameter

it is most often used in older c# programs

in order to use images from another origin on a canvas without tainting it the image must be served with cors headers
this page on mdn explains it but essentially when the image is served it has to be accompanied by an access-control-allow-origin header allowing the origin of your page potentially via the wildcard
unless the image is served that way putting it in the canvas will taint it and you won t be able to use getimagedata
so this isn t a javascript thing really
it s how the image is served that determines how you can use it

sun rmi client connection s timout is being controlled by the property sun.rmi.transport.tcp.responsetimeout which is by default set to no timeout waits forever
sun.rmi.transport.tcp.responsetimeout 1.4 and later
the value of
this property represents the length of time in milliseconds that the
client-side java rmi runtime will use as a socket read timeout on an
established jrmp connection when reading response data for a remote
method invocation
therefore this property can be used to impose a
timeout on waiting for the results of remote invocations
if this
timeout expires the associated invocation will fail with a
java.rmi.remoteexception
setting this property should be done with
due consideration however because it effectively places an upper
bound on the allowed duration of any successful outgoing remote
invocation
the maximum value is integer.max_value and a value of
zero indicates an infinite timeout
the default value is zero no
timeout
for the list of this and other parameters that can used to control rmi connections see sun.rmi properties

it s so easy to forget to mark a constructor explicit adding removing args making them optional etc
the single reliable way i know is to declare every constructor as explicit and then remove this keyword only if implicitness is required by design thanks to the standard that allows this not only on single-argument constructors
but this would look ugly
not intended implicit constructors open usage of mistaken implicit conversion e.g
as here
this can happen by accident or can break backward compatibility
so why explicit is not default characteristic of a constructor if this would lead to fewer bugs

yes you are right
the first one has a complexity of o n while the second stand at o n3 n cube
you can use a generator expression so that it generates the numbers as needed and they don t waste memory
in python 2 you can use xrange instead of range to keep it as a generator and avoid creating unnecessary lists
if you want to enter the actual stop point instead of the power to stop at this is probably the simplest way
you could put it all in one line
but that s becoming silly and not very readable

you really can t improve on having one thread reading the file sequentially assuming that you haven t done anything like stripe the file across multiple disks
with one thread you do one seek and then one long sequential read
with multiple threads you re going to have the threads causing multiple seeks as each gains control of the disk head
edit this is a way to parallelize the line processing while still using serial i o to read the lines
it uses a blockingqueue to communicate between threads
the filetask adds lines to the queue and the cputask reads them and processes them
this is a thread-safe data structure so no need to add any synchronization to it
you re using put e e to add strings to the queue so if the queue is full it can hold up to 200 strings as defined in the declaration in readingfile the filetask blocks until space frees up
likewise you re using take to remove items from the queue so the cputask will block until an item is available

i downloaded the latest version of gcc 6.2.0 using homebrew
it works great from the command line you have to make sure you really use it and not the g++ override that xcode does
if i try to tell xcode to use this version of gcc as the compiler it says it is incompatible
did i download the wrong thing
is this just because it s so new
in some cases it makes sense
but in the majority of cases use of it it considered poor practice because it can make the execution path of code tricky to read compared to using structured code such as for loops and while loops
when you look at a goto or a label you don t really know where is goes to or comes from without reading or searching through the code for the label name
this is tricky especially if the goto doesn t fit on the same screen as the label
compare this to a for loop or a while loop or an if
you can tell from the structure i.e
indenting of the code what the execution path is
having said this it sometimes is useful especially for example when jumping out of some nested for loops that are digging for a particular value inside a multi-dimensional array
you could use a goto here to jump out of the for loops when the correct value is found
you enable texturing but don t give your vertices any texture coordinates
you also don t give them normals so i hope you don t enable lighting
based on your statements about the initializers some of which i disabled before running the above and some of which i omitted you should really post the state in which the gl is when rendering this cube or before posting check it yourself
it may be that you even find the error yourself when fiddling out all the state changes your engine makes
in general you should rather degrade from explicit initialization code and always set all the states you need immediately before rendering as this prevents such strange things where you don t know in which state the gl really is
always remember opengl is a state machine
i am connecting two databases that are in 2 different servers like

but but i didn t found that the table was created even
you need to write an xmladapter that transforms a class a object containing a skipthiswrapper element into a class b object containing the someinternalcomplexstructure
this merely requires you to write class b by reusing the class for someinternalcomplexstructure and an adapter with the very simple transformations in both directions
if you have hand-written java classes it is quite simple but i refrain from inventing any code
you can find examples for adapters in very recent so qas tagged jaxb avoid empty sub-tags in xml if everything is blank in an object or jaxb can not handle xml element containing white space to java.net.uri mapping
if you need help add some java code to your q onto which the adapter can be fitted

how can i solve this error
note that my source code compiled successfully in visual studio
thanks
you are making a comparison as part of the while conditional which means you are only counting a successful comparison which is why your best case result is wrong
compcount++ should also be right above the while loop

target state porting vb6 code into c# undertake the whole project with all conceivable processes that are involved
what would be your approach if you do not have knowledge about the domain
there is nearly any documentation just legacy code up to 100.000 - 300.000 lines of code and comments vb6 files that contain up to 14.000 lines of code written in vb6
yes you are missing the fundamental thing over here
in your code
you are declaring x to be a string
it should be an expression which should evaluate to some value

im attempting to log the user activity in my database when they login and logout of the site
this works fine but when they close the page via a tab or browser there is no way to run the logout query so according to the records the user never logs out of the site
method 1
i have tried onbeforeunload but this does not seem to trigger before the page closes
method 2
i would try the method of using an ajax keepalive token sent to the php but this would need to run every 1 min and could cause high traffic load
method 3
i was hoping an alterantive would be to set the session.gc.maxlifetime to 1 min and add a call to the logout query via a destroy session callback
which would be the best method or is there a better method of achieving this
is there a way to trigger a custom function query before php destroy session or php garbage collection has taken place
update
i have taken the advise of everyone and decided to attempt method 1
so far this is my attempt but its still not working perfectly
can anyone suggest any improvments to how i can make this work well
although i have not tried them yet i found some possible solutions

i assume that by associated security group you mean a group used to grant users permissions to access the folder
there s no way for the os to identify inherently what purposes the groups in the acl are being used for so you need to determine some set of consistent criteria that can be used to identify which groups are associated security groups
some examples
are the associated security groups always the only security principals with permissions
if so that makes things simpler
but it s also very unlikely because you ll generally have at least builtin administrators domain admins nt authority system and creator owner.
do the groups follow some naming convention that can be derived from the folder names
for example i ve used a naming convention like acl_servername_sharename_permissionscode e.g
acl_hqfp01_shared-folder1-m
in that scenario it s always possible to identify the permissions group names given the share and subfolder names
are the groups always the only security principals with explicit i.e
non-inherited permissions
i m going to take a guess that you re following microsoft s recommended best practices that you re using ntfs permissions and you re not assigning explicit permissions to anything other than domain groups designated for that purpose which would make these associated security groups the only security principals with explicit permissions
in that case you can include a comma-separated list of these groups like this
you can get the members of the groups by importing the active directory module and using get-adgroupmember or there are more complicated ways to query ad without the module but exactly how depends on which way you want to grab them because if you can have multiple associated security groups for one folder then you can t do it in a one line per folder display at least not without making things very messy
rebuilding r from source does not appear necessary
here are the steps i used for a windows 7 x64 system running r 3.1.1 with rtools 3.1.0.1942
the implications of this update to gcc have not been thoroughly tested
start a clean r session and remove.packages rcpp and anything else rcpp related
close r session
download and run mingw-builds from link to mingw-builds installer
select gcc version 4.8.1 arch x64 threads posix exception sjlj build rev 5 and install to drive rtools mingw-builds ..
update the system path variable to include these entries in the following order at or near the top of path
the 3rd path entry replaces the one included by the rtools installer
restart or otherwise to reflect path changes
start a clean r session and run install.packages rcpp and repeat for all the other packages that were removed in step 1
these steps have been followed using r 3.1.1 2014-07-10 with rcpp 0.11.2
it is easiest to do this using rgui.exe and not via an ide such as rstudio due to the silent loading of previous workspaces and packages of the latter
test set-up by running system gcc -v in a r session to obtain
to confirm a selection of compiler bugs present with gcc 4.6.3 to 4.8.0 are no more as well as test some new c++11 features available with in a r session running rcpp sourcecpp on the following code saved as .cpp file should generate no compiler warnings or errors whereas this will totally fail using gcc 4.6.3

i m sorry if my question is somewhat vague
it s been a few years since i did anything with qt and back then i never did any fancy image stuff
what i m asking for below is just some general suggestions on which classes to consider using
i m trying to avoid barking up the wrong tree from the very start
the situation i m writing a qt-based program in which i need to display a somewhat large let s say 5000x5000 raster image
the user should be able to zoom quickly in and out and pan around the image in a way similar to for example google maps
so far this is not very different from the qt imageviewer example except perhaps for the requirement that zooming happens quickly
however i need to draw on the order of 50k simple geometric shapes let s say circles on top of the image and be able to add and remove some of these in a simple way
the circles should have the same size no matter the zoom level and should thus either be redrawn whenever the user zooms or should be drawn with vector graphics
think of the circles as map annotations
these should look the same at any zoom level and also behave nicely with respect to panning
i guess my question is twofold
can qt draw vector graphics on top of a raster image
in general which classes should i consider for the above
thanks in advance
i don t like answering vague questions myself but maybe someone with experience with qt s graphics capabilities has an answer
i ve been working on that for 2 days now

simple answer
you already answered your own question - embed the google ga js code
alternative answer
another alternative is that you could utilize forge.ajax and fire the .trackpageview method in the success callback
in this case you would have to add the proper domain permission in your config file
however isn t ga tied to a specific domain or group of domains
in the case of phonegap or trigger.io there is no domain name
also see this question answer -

i humbly suggest use a proper tool an html parser by using domdocument with domxpath instead of regular expressions
example sample fiddle
should output this
there are several questions out there that resemble this one
but i did not found this exact question on so
nor the answer elsewhere
i just need to know if a string is showing at least once
it might be possible that the string occurs more than once in the html that it is hidden one time and showing another time
it s about visibility in the page not necessarily in the viewport
thus if you have to scroll to view it that is ok too
update i know of contains and is visible that s not the problem
elements can be nested deep of course and it has to work in all circumstances
i want to zoom image on mouse hover in my web page
image is in a table cell
i applied transform scale 1.2
it works properly
but problem is that image has border-radius 10px and when mouse pointer goes on the image then image border-radius becomes zero
and after full transition it becomes 10px again
i want to keep it unchanged at the time of zooming
it is not working only in google chrome
css of this effect are as following..

thus i d like to be able to specify the hostname by commandline arguments
the test runner does argument parsing itself e.g
for chosing the tests to execute
what is the recommended method to handle this situation
you have so many too defind paths in there look at this snippet we use it in production and works like a charme
p.s
you do need the .net framework full install to be available on the build machine also notice my solution relative path which is relative to the folder from where my tfsbuild.proj is located
i have this file configured in an automated build of tfs and just works
also have a look at this question and answer is a separate visual studio license required for a build machine
i can t confirm this but i think the algorithm used by this function does something equivalent to computing the gradient for each function
which means that there will be a contour found on the outer edge and one on the inner edge just like you suggested
to confirm this you can try to use an input image where the circles have been filled with white elimininating the inner contour
you can also test with different parameters on the findcontours function
for example try using cv_retr_external instead of cv_retr_tree i assume the inner circle is nested within the outer one so this should force it to return only the outer ones

you can create a bytearrayinputstream with
and then read from this inputstream
if your interface only accepts a fileinputstream then the interface is broken..
if at all an interface only works with files it should accept a file else it should use an inputstream
also if you use threads you can use pipedinputstream and pipedoutputstream directly between the threads
here s a somewhat fixed up version of your code
however it checks if all numbers are the same e.g
5555 or 111

edit the c++ answer in the linked question works by constructing the reverse number gradually in the loop and finally checking if they re the same
this is a similar to what you are doing
here s another version for fun
the ipod touch 4g has about the same performance as an iphone 4
so if you don t want to target the iphone 3gs or if you don t care whether your app will run smoothly on iphone 3gs then the ipod touch 4g is a good testing device
however the iphone 3gs is still being sold so you might want to target that or use an ipod touch 3g which has similar performance but is cheaper
if you want to target iphone 3gs ipod touch 3g you might also want test with a retina device as these are standard now

as ian said you re taking an 8bit value uca0rxbuf is only 8 bits wide anyway and expecting to get a 32bit or 64 bit value out of it
in order to get a proper sample you would need to read uca0rxbuf multiple times and then concatenate each 8 bit value into 32 64 bits which you then would cast to a double
like ian i would also question the wisdom of doing floating point math in a low power embedded microcontroller
this type of task is much better suited to a dsp
at least you should use fixed point math seewikipedia even in a dsp you would use fixed point arithmetic

as already answered the startup items are a combination of startup items for all users and the current user
the startup items can either be placed as links in the start menu startup folders or as registry entries
for the startup folders you have already been given the paths in pax answer but do be aware that the paths will be different in non-english versions of windows
for the registry i don t think you can query it using batch script only
it can be done from powershell script if that is an option
otherwise i think the easiest way to accomplish the task would be to make a small utility program for the task
it would be easy to do in one of the .net languages or you can do it in c if you cannot rely on the .net framework being present
the registry entries can be found here for all users
and for the current user
finally be aware that the registry also contains the runonce key
which contains entries that only should be run once at startup and then be removed

the compiler will add padding to align some types in your structure
the amount of padding depends on the compiler what processor you compile for what compiler settings are used etc etc
as mentioned by unwind there are macros provided to calculate the offset into a structure offsetof type member which does the right thing
your code stuffs a float into the nomansland padding between your two char variables and the actual float variable which is why you are getting random results obviously not completely random - just not what you expect - it s entirely predictable if you know the difference in offset and figure out the bit-pattern of the floating point value that this provides

currently we have firstorcreate or firstornew but i don t think they really fit your needs
for instance firstorcreate will try to locate a row by all attributes not just some so an update in this case wouldn t make sense
so i think you really would have to find it but you can create a basemodel and create a createorupdate method that could look like this
this is untested code
this is an implementation of it
try this using equals
you could add a column to the end of the raw data with a simple if formula e.g
where a1 b1 are the columns to check and 4 and 6 would be replaced by the actual values
the check if a row exists is then just checking the sum of this column
where c is the column with the formula
on large excel docs i generally find a composite approach like this to be most efficient
if you post a sample of the data i may be able to refine further

copy those formulas on down
so this is probably a simple problem i m not seeing but here goes
this makes the popup come out and everything however after i click post and check my facebook wall
nothing is actually posted
what could be the issue
i m using ado.net ef and i need to implement some sort of custom rollback in my save method
the logic is this
i have an openfiledialog and the first step when save is called is to check if there is selected image and if there is to copy the selected image to a new location
then i set the properties for the entity including the picture name which is the reason i choose to copy the image first and check if there is no duplication of unique values with this method hasduplicatingentity entity
if the copy process went well and there is no entity with the same unique value just then i save the entity itself save entity
if something went wrong with save entity i just have to delete the previously copied image if there is such and that s it
the actual implementation is something like this
the problem that occurs is that if i try to save a new entity with chosen image but hasduplicatingentity entity returns true
then with the current logic i just show the user that there is already an entity with the same unique value and then just return false which in the cases when an image is selected and then copied leaves me with an unused image in my file system
which leads me to my exact question
i have a method that is meant to delete the image in case of some problem but it s called in the catch clause
now when i see that there is another place where i might need to delete an image i see two options - just calling the method from within the if
which is kinda logical but except the method call i have some checks to find out if there is in fact a copied image because the image is not required and that will result in a few line of repeating code
the other option is to throw exception and go to the catch clause where i already deal with this problem but that means to change the current way this situation is managed
this exact part
is inherited and i don t have much experience so i don t want to turn something good to something bad so i want to know which is the correct way to deal with this issue
is it possible to break execution when a watch variable not a property just a normal variable changes to see where the change occurred
i searched and found this question which relates to properties it seems which is not what i m looking for
this variable is used several times in several thousand lines of code but it is only changed from null when a problem happens
we are trying to track that problem down
the trick is to print the correct number of spaces before the
you method
won t do that it will print a number of blank lines
but if you swap system.out.println for system.out.print it should do the trick
then as an example for a triangle of size 5 you would
print 4 spaces and a
print 3 spaces and 2 s
print 2 spaces and 3 s
print 1 space and 4 s
print 5 s
you can do that in a loop
you can try something like the following
there is actually a pretty simple way to get this done
the current behavior is obviously a bug so this is not an ideal solution but simply a workaround that works beautifully
namely use an additional uiview as a disabled visual cue
the general steps
add a uiview as a sibling to the uisegmentedcontrol
ensure the uiview is in front of the uisegmentedcontrol
apply the desired color and a transparency to the uiview to match your app skin
move the uiview to be exactly on top of the uisegmentedcontrol
shape the uiview to have the exact size top of the uisegmentedcontrol
apply a rounded corner to the uiview to mirror the exact shape of the uisegmentedcontrol
when the uisegmentedcontrol is supposed to be disabled simply show the uiview and disable the user interaction on the uisegmentedcontrol
when the uisegmentedcontrol is supposed to be enabled simply hide the uiview and enable the user interaction on the uisegmentedcontrol
in both cases do not change the uisegmentedcontrol.enabled property
note that it seems like a lot of steps but all of this can be coded in so to add support for disabling your custom uisegmentedcontrol becomes pretty much a 1 liner after you add this to a configure segmented control method
here is how my custom segmented control looks when applying this solution
enabled segmented control
disabled segmented control
here are some code snippets of interest
shape the uiview to match the uisegementedcontrol load time configuration

if your need is to store users messages and the amount of messages is large the data whatever organized it could be will be large
but this is the purpose of the database to store data
your approach is the simplest and most efficient
nothing wrong with it
the messages table with one record per message seems to be proper and relational way
think of the numbers
even if every user sends 10 messages a day how likely is this
it makes 100k records a day or 36m a year
it s not really a huge amount
design indexing carefully and it should be fine
with long-term planning you may go for compression partitioning if your database supports it and pruning archiving of old messages

before you filter your data first create a temporary column to populate your entire data set with your original sort order
auto number the temporary original sort order column
now filter your data
copy and paste the filtered data into a new worksheet
this will move only the filtered data to the new sheet so that your row numbers will become consecutive
now auto number your desired field
go back to your original worksheet and delete the filtered rows
copy and paste the newly numbered data from the secondary sheet onto the bottom of your original worksheet
then clear your filter and sort the worksheet by the temporary original sort order column
this will put your newly numbered data back into its original order and you can then delete the temporary column
while circling in karnaugh map you always have to make circles of 2 n size in each direction 1x1 2x1 4x1 2x2 4x4 ... but never 1x3 3x3 5x3

wav-file is not the best tool to buffer encoded data for further streaming
i would prefer to use ffserver
the idea is that ffmpeg encodes stream and uploads it onto ffserver s feed file and clients e.g
your remote computer are getting the stream it may be the same stream in different formats from ffserver by
just add audio stream there connect ffmpeg to its feed and connect that remote computer to the stream
define single stream in ffserver.conf
or avi mpegts flv whatever
start audio encoding uploading to the server
start getting rtp avi etc stream on that remote computer

it may be because your web user doesn t have ssh access permission
to change that
- go to your domain control panel

yes the .close and .dispose issue is a bit unfortunate
it is was
an official ms guideline though
the close method is called a domain specific alias
and like the word alias suggests you may assume that they do exactly the same
usually close will just call dispose
the using .
end using block will only compile with a reference that is idisposable has .dispose
general advice
when a class has a .dispose use ausing block
using is just short-hand for try .

don t get creative trying to combine or economize multiple blocks
when the nesting gets to deep 3..5 factor out an extra method
the mechanism we use frequently is by having a few generic event listeners on the body and have all required events bubble up
once caught we check for a certain classname or classname pattern on the triggering element
if such a classname is found we consider it a state identifier and we trigger behavior based on such states
for instance we have defined classname pairs such as selected and unselected with the default behavior of toggling
or make them exclusive by giving the parent element the classname exclusive-selected
a simple mechanism like that can be extended to your liking and can be very powerful
allow me to post a simple demonstration
non-generic but it is just to illustrate the inner workings of such a mechanism
for this example i consider the classname pair selected and unselected to be exclusive
it ought to work on ie firefox and other browsers
of course this mechanism can be made generic and have all kinds of classname states and behaviors implemented

i am creating a line chart and i want to increase the height or thickness of the line without changing the length of the line
before increasing the width property it looks like this
after increasing the width property it looks like this
i want to increase just the height but there is no such property for this so i tried altering the width property
unfortunately this increases both the length and width
is there anyway to alter only the height
if i increase the width as you can see the space between the lines disappears

see convert big endian to little endian in c for more discussion and code
the first thing you should do if it s not the case is version control your project
i d recommend using git
in addition to the benefits of managing the changes made to the application when developing it will aldo make it easier to share copies between developers.
or with the production deployment
indeed production can just be a git clone of the project just like your development instance
the second thing is you need to install the project in your python library path
this is how all the imports and includes are going to work
i d recommend creating a virtual environment for this with either virtualenv or pew so that your app and its dependencies are isolated from the rest of your system and other apps
you probably have a setup.py script in your project
if not create one
then install your project with pip install
in production or pip install -e
in development
with the help i got in codereview i made this class
i m trying to build a registration system with codeigniter
i have a controller called user with the following code
so far so good
if i go to the register page i get the registration form displayed
if i send the form and it passes the form validation checks i get the success page if the form has errors i get the form back with some error messages
now what i want to do is the database stuff
i have some idea of how i can get the post values from the registration form into my database but no clue how i can check if a username or email already exists and if so display that error on the registration form
and when i register in form how can i send activation to user email to active account in my site
here s my registration form view
and module is -
you can make your main activity as your launch activity
in the onresume of your main activity you check if the user is logged in
if not you start your login activity
you can use a variable as cook_time in the states transitions and while building the stateflow it will detect it automatically then you can specify it as input from simulink in the gui
follow these steps

i have a simple trait as defined below
my case class which implements this trait is as below
coming from a java world i find it a bit difficult to fathom the fact that mycaseclass actually implements this just by defining a parameter to mycaseclass
i understand that thy byte code would actually write the getter and setter
but how is this possible without any var or val
my understanding is that if there is no var or val then there is no getter or setter method generated
in that case how is the above case class mycaseclass implementing mystringval method

i ve got two laravel 4.2 sites running
i ve added it to the homestead.yaml added it to my hosts file and provisioned the vm

even tried destroying the vm and re creating it which would look like a hosts file issue but if i ssh in and ping newsite.dev it just times out where as i can ping oldsite.dev
i can see the site in var nginx sites-available and var nginx sites-enabled

does anyone have any suggestions for further debugging

i have an nx4 array of vertices that i d like to plot using glvertexarray and gldrawarray
as a 2d scatter plot
i currently initialize the array like so
then i draw the 2d scatter with
which shows up correctly as this
note the colored squares in the background are so i can easily judge if the points are falling in the correct location
however as i m only want a 2d plot i d like to skip over the 2 unused dimensions
i tried telling glvertexpointer that my vertices only have 2 points and then setting the stride between vertices as 2 as well but that doesn t seem to be working as i thought it should
however when i plot this i get a very different result with points showing up at xxy yxz zxw
have i misunderstood the proper function of the stride variable
if not how can i properly set the stride so the bottom plot resembles the top plot

i work in an environment where we have a custom preprocessor for our fortran code
i use the pre-processor to toggle logical parameters as a sort of poor man s function pointers
i realized today that i had a situation similar to this
in other words func1 is not anywhere defined but this compiles with gfortran version 4.4 and 4.6 because presumably the compiler optimizes that call away
i don t have other compilers to check against at the moment does this code compile elsewhere
could should this be considered a compiler bug
part of the reason i toggle logical switches instead of including not including code is so that the compiler can still check the interface syntax if capable inside that block of code and issue appropriate warnings for things that aren t simple function calls
does this imply those tests aren t being performed or just that the function isn t required by the linker so it all goes through ok
well i have an html table with some trs something like these bellow
and there is a simple selector
which in firefox returns the trs with selected true but in msie 8-9 it returns nothing
i guess the problem is that the attribute selected is not supposed to be used by trs and ie finds it invalid or something like this
but the code bellow returns the value of the attribute selected.
there is also something noticeable that this code works with jquery 1.4.2 also in ie
by upgrading to jquery 1.8.3 it works only in ff
changing the name of the attribute is a solution that i would like to avoid for some reasons
the solution that i have in mind is a loop for each tr if selected true add tr in var a
is there a better suggestion

i m having trouble accessing the contents of a textbox inside the cell of a table that was created from the code behind
in my small program the table is pre-populated with a student s name cell a1
a textbox is added to the cell below it cell a2
the user enters pass or fail into the textbox and clicks submit
at that point a message should read the students status was changed to whatever the user entered
this is the problem -- since the textbox id student1 is assigned in the code behind the textbox id does not yet exist in the context
the predicate doesn t just yield 5 as an answer
if you run it it yields several answers 5 6 6 6 7 7 6 7 and 7
the structure t v l r represents a binary tree
reformatting the query to make it a little more visible
or to lay the first argument more like a tree so we can visualize it
now let s consider the rules defined by q3
a node that has no child nodes counts as zero 0
it doesn t count
a node that has at least one nul child counts as 1
a node that has two children regardless of what they are counts as 1 plus the sum of the quantity given for each the two children
we can see from these definitions of the predicate clauses any node that has two nul children will satisfy clauses 1 2 or 3
so each such node could potentially contribute to 3 solutions on backtracking
however predicates 2 and 3 will prune solutions below nodes that have exactly one nul child
there s only one branch of the tree that doesn t have the only-one-null child and that s the branch starting with node value 9
each of the sub-branches since they have two nul nodes contributes 3 solutions
so that s 3x3 or 9 total solutions that emerge which is what we see 5 6 6 6 7 7 6 7 and 7
to determine where 5 comes from which is the first solution you just need to see which clause succeeds first for each node
if we add these up we get node 4 sums to 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 5 really just counting up the 1 s in the above
backtracking where other rules will also match yields the other 8 values
it looks like q3 is attempting to count nodes but doing so incorrectly
to do this correctly let s start over with defining the rules
if a node is nul it should count as zero
if a node is not null then the count of nodes should be the sum of the count of nodes of the left and right branches plus 1 for the current node
using these two clauses we get
one solution 11 which is the count of nodes
i think that since it s explicitly declared it makes more sense seeing an actual argument called self rather than this
from the grammatical point of view at least self is not as context dependent as this

in xcode 7.3 you need to use the #selector

i think that works
that expression should not return attribute values
this looks like a bug in the php xpath implementation
in xpath is short for descendant-or-self node
descendants do not include attributes
even if they did text without an axis is short for child text and attributes do not have child nodes
so you need a workaround
the fully expanded expression you re using is
so let s try tweaking that
instead of node try which only matches elements
or try using the text node test directly on the descendant-or-self axis
seems like subtracting or adding if a is negative by b until you hit or cross 0 would be an easy implementation albeit almost certainly not the most efficient
i am missing a curly brace that i cannot find

you re using gldeletetextures incorrectly in the second case
the first parameter to that function is how many textures you wish to delete and the second is an array of texture names or a pointer to a single texture name
you ll need to do something like the following
where texturename is the name of the texture obtained at its creation
it looks like that value is stored within the texid component of the image struct passed into loadtexture
that doesn t fully explain the crash you see which seems like a memory management issue with your input image possibly an autoreleased object that is being discarded before you access its cgimage component
once you use parametric constructor you need to call it using parameters .php doesn t support constructor overloading like c# but their are many workarounds
this is because the requests are asynchronous
this means that they are not guaranteed to be returned in the order in which they are sent
if you need to maintain the order you need to sort the object after the requests have completed
try this
that information is sent in the headers
if it s not already set in the headers it will simply return null
so no simply retrieving a cookie server-side is not detectable from the browser

you can use extern alias to differentiate between two type names that are identical apart from the assembly in which they are contained
set an alias for system.data.services.client - say systemdatav4

extern alias systemdatav4
then you can either have

note the prefix of the namespace with the alias e.g

composite keys can be good - they may affect performance - but they are not the only answer in much the same way that a unique surrogate key isn t the only answer
what concerns me is the vagueness in the reasoning for choosing composite keys
more often than not vagueness about anything technical indicates a lack of understanding - maybe following someone else s guidelines in a book or article...
there is nothing wrong with a single unique id - infact if you ve got an application connected to a database server and you can choose which database you re using it will all be good and you can pretty much do anything with your keys and not really suffer too badly
there has been and will be a lot written about this because there is no single answer
there are methods and approaches that need to be applied carefully in a skilled manner
i ve had lots of problems with id s being provided automatically by the database - and i avoid them wherever possible but still use them occasionally
assuming you only want the keys use the keys property
if you want to just get all the keys in an easy-to-read manner in the immediate window you could use
or pre-.net 4
.
or if you re using .net 2 something like this
if you want to get the values at the same time you can iterate over the keyvaluepair entries as per yaakov s answer

i suspect that the problem is that your chart view is persisting for longer than your activity and is therefore being added to a parent multiple times without being removed when the parent is destroyed

alternatively you could try instantiating a new chart in oncreate

i want to run some subprocess calls in parallel using the multiprocessing module
my simple example is basically calling a function that waits for 5 seconds prints an output then waits for another 5 seconds before terminating
i want the function to be locked until it prints out a line of code anything really and then allow other processes to continue working as well
here is an illustration
where the contents of script_test.py is as follows
it seems like this is not running in parallel
the total time takes 40.7s for me with ncpu equal to 4 but there should only be about plus overhead since the first 5 seconds are locked and the last 5 should not for each process
i am running the script_test.py as an example but in practice this will be an executable file
my questions are
how can i utilize locks properly to accomplish the above
i am running the script from a command prompt but i don t see any output
how would i print the output of the subprocess from within the child processes launched by the multiprocessing module

the taskbar chooses the right icon size for it s size this is much more important in window 7

isn t the lilypad a 3.3v arduino so that means it should be 3.3 1024.0 which would be 0.726v or 22.6 c
try this -- you can substitute any value or variable for the user_id in the where clause.
there is no reason the two modules can t be linked together into a single program

routes routes.js returns an approuter object which can then be run as the only approuter in the marionette app
events events.controller.js just a snippet
it turns out that i could only run processapproutes on the approuter before it had been instantiated with new and only once
by defining a routes object inside the controller which isn t used by the controller i can access it in the routes.js file and iterate through the routes and methods to create an approuter object with all the routes for the entire app
adding a new controller is as easy as requiring it inside the controllers object

the question is underspecified since you did not say how the input and output are presented
for finite lists the answer is yes as in this python code
for infinite sets how are you going to present them
if you show only a small sample of input this does not specify the whole algorithm
guessing the best fit is undecidable
if you have a magic blackbox then there are continuum many mappings but only a countable number of programs so it s impossible
it appeared to be that the engine i was getting the normals information required some transform to screen coords first so definitely not the problem of the shader

you cannot use a header server-side redirect when you call a file using ajax
instead you would have to check the results in the success function of your ajax call and use javascript to redirect if the login processed correctly
because you have a bug actually several bugs
in particular in get_fibo_index you realloc some memory then in main read right past the end of the allocated buffer which produces totally undefined result
rebuild your program with -g re-run it under valgrind and fix all invalid errors it finds
rebuilding with -g will give you file and line info that will make fixing the errors easier.

a created out of a file descriptor using fdopen will provide the additional features of buffering error checking feof ferror etc which you may or may not need
i don t see any benefit of using a fdopen mainly because the pipe itself will do certain level of buffering on modern linux it s 64k
besides in most use-cases where pipes are used in ipc buffering isn t desirable
so i don t see any benefit of using fdopen
using read write directly will be sufficient and often desirable in ipc
in case of games i doubt you really want nanosecond precision in waking up
what you do want though is avoiding accumulating error which is what your code is trying to do
it s a reasonable approach although it probably would make more sense to use a timer instead

suppose i have an object dog of class dog whose properties can be divided into two groups
a properties that must be initialized only once when dog is allocated
b properties that must be re-initialized reset every once in a while
so i need a method resetb which resets properties in group b using self i.e
in order to avoid duplicated code the actual situation is much more complicated with tens of properties i d like to call resetb from my init so that init wuold look like this
ok but now i m worried that i m messaging self from my init method which people say is considered.
impolite .
so to speak
my questions are do i worry too much about etiquette and it is actually safe to do as above
or maybe duplicate code which must be kept in sync is the lesser evil
or there is another correct way of doing this
according to this reference which has almost all that you need to know about window.open the following are the properties you are interested in
toolbar and chrome features
...
location
if this feature is on then the new secondary window renders the location bar in mozilla-based browsers
msie 5+ and opera
7.x renders the address bar
mozilla and firefox users can force new windows to always render the location bar by setting
dom.disable_window_open_feature.location to true in about config or in
their user.js file
supported in internet explorer 5+ netscape 6.x netscape 7.x
mozilla 1.x firefox 1.x opera 6+
...
window functionality features
...
dialog
menusystemcommands.pngthe dialog feature removes all icons restore minimize maximize from the window s titlebar leaving only
the close button
mozilla 1.2+ and netscape 7.1 will render the other
menu system commands in ff 1.0 and in ns 7.0x the command system
menu is not identified with the firefox ns 7.0x icon on the left end
of the titlebar that s probably a bug
you can access the command
system menu with a right-click on the titlebar
dialog windows are
windows which have no minimize system command icon and no
maximize restore down system command icon on the titlebar nor in
correspondent menu item in the command system menu
they are said to
be dialog because their normal usual purpose is to only notify info
and to be dismissed closed
on mac systems dialog windows have a
different window border and they may get turned into a sheet
supported in netscape 6.x netscape 7.x mozilla 1.x firefox 1.x
...
features requiring privileges
the following features require the universalbrowserwrite privilege
otherwise they will be ignored
chrome scripts have this privilege
automatically others have to request it from the privilegemanager
...
close
when set to no or 0 this feature removes the system close command icon and system close menu item
it will only work for dialog
windows dialog feature set
close no will override minimizable yes
mozilla and firefox users can force new windows to always have a close
button by setting dom.disable_window_open_feature.close to true in
about config or in their user.js file
supported in netscape 6.x netscape 7.x mozilla 1.x firefox 1.x

for widget edit the method rubyrailswidget#gettemplatepath in order to return the absolute path to the widget file rather than the class path see more in widgets - development mode
for web app edit the file war sonar-server web-inf config environment.rb and set the absolute path to your ruby application by replacing the property config.plugin_paths see more in applications - development mode
increment can be done with one operation e.g.
try this
you should use prop instead of so many functions to be honest use delegate instead of on for late static binding

let me know where i am wrong
i think the solution might be as simple as making sure you set both self._position 0 and 1 as well as self.rect.x and y
if you change only self.rect.x then in the next call of update it will use the previous values stored in self._position
storing the position as a float is a good solution and has worked well for me in the past
i have a quick hopefully question on how to implement a composite field using mvvm
i have 2 examples one is on the sql end i am storing gps coordinates in the following manner latitude longitude for instance 45.55555 -80.00000
the other example is storing feet and inches as a single double field with it being ft.in
how should i go about this
should i have two fields and in the model or viewmodel composite them if the other piece exists
should i bind them to the same field and somehow validate the sets

to do first step i create a static library project on visual studio 2013
i add opencv library to this vs project
i have installed opencv2.4.10 so i didn t install again opencv
my steps are below
now i should do third step
but which files i should copy to inside the folder
all project or a spesific file
i put 2 files that created using 64bit lib files named visual studio 2013 projects opencvstaticdll x64 debug opencvstatic object file library and visual studio 2013 projects opencvstaticdll opencvstaticdll x64 debug opencvstatic precompiled header file inside the asset plugins folder on step 4
i create them using 32bit same way and put them under c program f
les x86 unity editor
i put all opencv_.lib under x86 vc12 staticlib under c program f
les x86 unity editor
opencv-c++ code
unity c# code
you can test it in this jsfiddle here better is to see on new jsfiddle see edit part of this post
i think there is a bug in angularjs or at least not an expected result
if i detach a form then re-append it it s class ng-invalid switch to ng-valid on re-append it to the dom
this has for consequence to enable the submit button of the form even data aren t valid
of course i was expecting that validity status didn t switch
i think it s a angular bug but maybe a jquery one
i could use jquery to check on append if form was valid or not and then forcing form class but it s seems not working as a valid form get then the status of invalid
it s quite weird as i don t know any other workaround without using kind of data to saved status form before detaching it
so anyone has already encountered this problem
is there any method if possible using angularjs directive to get rid of this bug
ps i need to detach form and any other elements in a single page web application to keep dom as clean as possible
edit
i ve done a new jsfiddle that is illustrating more my problem detaching content on internal site navigation
update
i come to this temporary solution thanks to caiotoon
this need more testing regarding multiple inputs validation
i ll certainly updating answer when all tests will be done
i need to remove a certain key of my array since i m creating a filter for my data
i want to remove the key meaning the number 2 that has the value xyz
how can i remove it
i need to remove it because i am filtering the array that was thrown to me by another script and i need to remove the key
i tried using for loop but i do not know how to remove it
my problem with hyper-v is that it kills performance on some things on the host os especially a v stuff
whenever i would be playing music on the host os and do something that hits the disk hard like compiling the music would begin skipping
similarly playing streaming video you d have to wait until it was completely downloaded before it would play without skipping
i ve since switched back to vmware and couldn t be happier
i have the following code
the first part retrieves a multidimensional array from the database
its structure is like this
second part
with this code i am trying to create another array of content based on the product code
however its just overriding the data in the array with each pass until only the last set is stored in the array because its a for loop
this has got my stumped and is probably obvious but how would i iterate through and create another array exactly like the first but with the new data
you can put all the events in one string in your code so there s only one place to manage it
and if you re using both .on and .off you can use namespaces too
then you can use it like this
if you also want to remove the event handlers after they fire you can do use namespacing to help with that
then you can use it like this
you could also make your own jquery plug-in method that handles this for you
you would then use it like this
the string length attribute works for c#
i would recommend you using knockout subscribe to update dividers whenever your observablearray is changed and refresh listview contents
to maintain your list in the sorted state you should update the observablearray with already sorted value when you push delete something to from it
this will save you from updating the ui multiple times
i want to run bash commands with special parameters like _ inside the dockerfile
i tried the following example but it seems to be not working
if i execute the same command in the bash directly it works like a charm
does anyone have an idea what i m doing wrong
write a shell script to run on schedule
this script will trigger jps command on path hbase bin
your shell script will start with something like this
jps something.txt
...
...
place a check in the script i.e
if the result of this jps command returns hmaster hregionserver process names then it means hbase is not down
in case any of the process is missing then hbase is down hence you can trigger mail through your script
upon entering protected mode the cr3 register points to a page directory you can put it anywhere you want before you enter protected mode which is a page of memory remember a small page is 4 kib and a large page is 4 mib with 1024 page directory entries pdes that point to to page tables
each entry is the top 10 bits of a pointer the address of the page table plus a bunch of flags that make up the bottom portion of the pointer present permission dirty etc.
the 1024 just comes from the fact that a page is 4096 bytes and a pointer is 4 bytes.
each page table is itself 1024 page table entries ptes which again contains 1024 entries that point to physical pages in memory along with a bunch of almost the same flags
so to translate a 32-bit virtual address you take the top 10 bits of the pointer as an index into the table at cr3 since there are 210 entries and -- if that pde is further subdivided meaning it isn t a large page which you can figure out from the flags -- you take the top 20 bits of the pde look up the page table at that address and index into it with the virtual address s next-topmost 10 bits
then the topmost 20 bits refer you to the physical page assuming the bottom 12 bits tell you the physical page is actually present
if you re using physical address extension pae then you get another level in the hierarchy at the very top
note for your own sanity and maybe the cpu s you d probably want to map the page directory and the page table to themselves otherwise things get confusing fast

the tlb is hardware-managed -- so the caching of the page tables is transparent -- but there is an instruction invlpg that invalidates a pte in the the tlb for you
i don t know exactly when you should use it and when you shouldn t.

we just started network-programming in school and now i got a problem with my homework im not the best programmer
so basically i got a java chatroom with 3 classes
a clienthandler that gets startet as a thread when a client connects to server a servermain class and a clientframe class where my gui is stored
so everytime i connect to the server via terminal with telnet localhost 10023 a new thread of clienthandler gets started and i can chat via terminal with other users
but how does the whole thing work with my gui
sry for my bad english btw

if your line needs to change the number of rows betwen means each time then you ll need to add a variable as you comment suggests
also just writing the string to the cells value activecell.value means that you will see it written as a formaula when you click the cell in the workbook and it ll highlight the range etc.
you could try replacing it with
although since i can t see the first row of your sheet i m not certain that ll give you the correct range of rows each time
if your row number is likely to change and you are copying over the same number of columns each time then it might also be just as easy to write the formula directly to cells within a loop rather than explicitly copying it
adding text after every 6th mean would require you to keep count of how many means had passed so far
this can be done by incrememnting a counter variable and using the mod operator will tell you the remainder after a division
therefor numberofmeans mod 6 will give you the remainder when divided by 6 and when this equals zero you know you have a multiple of 6
i ve tried to capture all this into the code below....
i also noticed your point on the value of area changing periodically
writing this programatically as above will aloow you to add some logic over the value of area and when it changes
you just need the --root flag available since git 1.7.12 i.e. to everyone except certain unnamed never-updated coughcentoscough linux distributions
consider that the result of squashing a and b is sort of commits don t quite obey this simple algebra but it works for our case just a + b
therefore since b + a a + b it does not matter whether you squash commit #1 into commit #2 or commit #2 into commit #1
of course this does not count the squashed-together commit s message so let s take a closer look at that
suppose you have run git rebase -i --root so as to be able to rebase everything including the root commit
you now have
change the second one to squash and write the file and exit the editor
git squashes the two commits together and brings up your editor again and you see
the precise details depend on your git version as well of course as the commit contents
since you are in your favorite editor it is easy to construct whatever new commit message you want
for instance you can just delete the entire first commit s message if that s what you want
do that write the file and exit the editor and you are all set
if different tabs can be selected by the user between save operations you might need to consider binding some kind of click function using jquery to set the selectedtabindex javascript variable
alternatively you could set a hidden input s value to the selected tab index
in either case if you need the value in your controller to set viewdata viewbag some model data etc when a save operation is submitted you could submit the data via and return some json from your controller
and your controller might look something like

yes you can rent a server or buy one but i wouldn t suggest that
the most popular way to host databases nowadays is using cloud computing
you should probably look into amazon aws

your first set of bullets are not the function of an installer it s a function of your build automation continuous integration system
your second set of bullets are all implemented by wix except for oracle
mssql only is natively supported
wix is a tool to author windows installer msi databases
it s important to understand that msi is not a scripting language
it is not an imperative procedural or oo programming model it is a declarative programing model
msi abstracts how to do something from what to do
table data wix elements and attributes describes what needs to be done and msi standard actions and wix built-in custom actions implement the how to do it
msi at install time evaluates table data and generates a script to install uninstall rollback and commit installation changes inside of an installation transaction
the reason this is important is that once you understand the patterns a tough hill to climb i ll admit your installers are much simpler robust and scalable
i ve written tomes of installers using scripting languages in the past and my productivity and reliability is much better using msi
i m guessing you really want somthing like

i usually end up performing a bulk copy operation to a temporary table and then copy data from it to the target table using regular sql
this allows me to perform bulk updates as well as take care of special situations like this although i haven t encountered this specific need
there s a performance hit compared to straight bulk copy but it s still a lot faster than performing inserts
i know dalli caching is pretty useful to enhance performance for static sites
but what about dynamic sites which are updated quite often
what is the correct way to set up dalli
one problem i ve encountered for example dalli recognizes different params page as the same page when using pagination
how would you guys design the system when using dalli for both
the page that gets updated so often
the page that won t be updated so often
my current code is just like this
that s why i m facing the pagination problem when using caching..

you can take the c code almost without changes
or did you think of something more sophisticated
it means that the declaring type or a base-class of that has an indexer which presumably takes an int or similar and returns.
something perhaps object

the code calls the indexer s get accessor passing 0 as the index - and then treats the returned value as a collapsingrecordnodeitemlist or null the returned value isn t compatible with that
for example
easiest thing to do is the step into it though
that will tell you exactly where it is going

i d like to ask a question about the error i encounter when i try to use repast hpc in xcode 5.1
repast hpc is an agent-based simulation library based on c++
for more information go to
for testing i tried to build and run the repast hpc tutorial demo code from tutorial page
i succeeded to run demo00 step 04 which seems to mean that my preference setting is correct but failed to run demo00 step 05
the major difference between those two is repastprocess.h is included in step 05
the error occurs in 50th line of logger.h file which is included repastprocess.h
the line of error is
typedef enum _loglevel debug info warn error fatal log_level
the error is parse issue error and the message says expected and the location of error seems to be debug because there is a tiny triangle under the word
i googled a lot but i couldn t find any issue in the code
does anybody face similar error
is it the problem of xcode setting
many thanks in advance
as i ve understood the browser will freeze all dom rendering when it sees a script tag and only continues once it has processed it
when i inserted an external javascript file typekit directly in the html this seemed to be the case but now that i m including it dynamically it causes a repaint of the window
is it possible fixing this issue
i m playing around with yui3 and yes i know the y.get.script works as well but i wanted to try it without the framework as well
using the framework function causes the same sort of repaint
live example
with loader

breakpoint is at the self.tableview... line
this is the first time i ve come across such an error
i m messing with a cocoapod that implements swipe to delete functionality

i m trying to use jdbc to connect with sql but i have a problem

i want to know what northwind means and how can i create one
a dictionary based solution would be required
this might be simplified somewhat if you have a limited dictionary of words that can occur otherwise words that form the prefix of other words are going to be a problem
output your code to console
you may also need to fix the bug on power
the reason the collection cannot bind is because the script executes before the dom is loaded
you need to move tag
from the head tag to the end of the body tag
this will ensure that the dom is in existence before your script executes
source i am the developer of forerunnerdb
put the following right after the open php tag
if this doesn t work there is a probably a parse error and then you ll need to check the error log
you will also need to escape your values that you are putting in the queries
this maybe causing a mysql query to fail
if someone puts a in _post team_name your first query may fail
another final possible problem are you sure it can still connect to mysql
an option to find the problem is commenting out large portions of code and then piece by piece uncommenting sectons
edit so your first problem is the mysql_connect line
it needs to be changed to notice the quotes also the variable and are spelt wrong in this line and used in their correct spelling i haven t checked the rest but there maybe other errors that will cause your script to break
some of the errors list are important to fix but won t break your script
escaping check out the following page
check the sample code on this page to find out how to connect to mysql and check to see if you are connected
another suggestion are you sure none of your queries are failing
you probably want to check if the result from query is false before continuing like
you mention that data.field inowner is of type int
would you expect the following to compile
i am implementing the new asp.net identity 2.0 framework in an existing website uses ca s identity minder which primarily uses request.servervariables to power all the controls
what i am trying to do is populate the request headers with the same variables that ca does on every request in the beginrequest event with an http handler but using the new identity provider
i know that in the beginrequest event i have access to read cookies from the client and i know that i can check if the owin cookie is there named .aspnet.applicationcookie but i don t know how i can decrypt the cookie to get the claims out of it
i have also tried doing this to read the claims
when i do this however i get nothing for the value so i am assuming that the thread.currentprincipal isn t populated this early in the request pipeline
this code does work however
so considering that i do have access to the cookie i was wondering if there was any way that i could decrypt it so i can read the claims that i have set inside of it
here is how i am setting my claims on the login page
if it s in individual files you can just pass each entry s url in domdocument load
if it s one large xml file you may want to instead use xmlreader - still you can pass the url into xmlreader open then use next to move from one entry to another
use xmlreader expand to get each entry s details as a dom object
same applies if it s a local copy - point to the file path
if you declare the return type func as float the result will be returned in the fpu st0
for returning a value in eax you have to declare it as an integer type
for printf you have to fake a float

i need to compare enums but note sure how to access them
i get live events which are string
i need to compare it with the set of set of strings to do necessary action
i tried to use enum but its not working
i am trying to compare in switch case
there s no real way to do what you re talking about
in this example your string is just a string
you then try to reference it like an object
in this case you would get a fatal error because you re telling php to use an object where none exists
the closest thing to what you describe is direct chaining where you create an instance of the class and reference it in the same statement available in php 5.4

it might be a color profile issue
for instance if the image is a jpeg and has a color profile and your browser doesn t support displaying images in the color profiles that they specify the colors of the image itself will render differently in your browser
in this situation if you checked the color of the image in photoshop color profile aware and then applied that color in your css and viewed the page in a browser that is not color profile aware it would look different

unless i ve misunderstood the question all you should have to do is cast the cstring to a lpctstr to use it with windows api functions
see here for a description
because the tvitem psztext member is a lptstr you will need to cast again to non-const however this should be safe for actions like tvm_insertitem as the string you supply is not modified

rather than
use an ssh tunnel to connect a local psql to the remote postgresql so you can copy files locally e.g
then while that session is open in a separate local terminal session
to connect over the ssh tunnel
this will only work if the remote system allows tcp ip connections from localhost 127.0.0.1 1
it doesn t have to allow tcp ip postgresql connections from remote nodes
alternately you can
to stream stdout over ssh to a local file
note the two layers of quoting because the local shell consumes the first layer and the remote shell consumes the second layer
generally the best solution is to enable postgresql to listen on external public ports with ssl set up and use hostssl entries in pg_hba.conf to allow yourself to connect directly over tcp ip using psql with ssl
then you d just

i have been doing desktop applications since i have started programming and i have not really looked at the web side of things
seeing how fast this market is growing i convinced myself that i should learn a web framework
i learned some php and i found it to be quick but after projects get beyond small it becomes a hassle
so looking at recommendations online i took up ruby on rails
now when i go through the ruby on rails guide i don t really feel like i m understanding anything or really writing any code
i just feel like i m editing configuration files

fyi i m using this as a tutorial
when i coded in php i immediately understood what the code was doing but with rails i really don t understand how all of it comes together

this should work for your fiddle example
however it will only work on links inside the headings and i m not sure that s what you re looking for
if you want something that works for any contents inside a certain element with any level of tag nesting then you ll need a recursive approach
here is an idea which is basically plain javascript since jquery does not provide a way to target dom text nodes

we are using kafka for storing messages and pushing an extremely large number of messages 30k in a minute
i am not sure if its relevant but the code that is the producer of the kafka message is in jruby
serialising and deserialising the messages also has a performance impact on the system
can someone help with comparing avro vs protocol buffer in terms of speed of serialisation and deserialisation
you could just use a for loop
adjust accordingly

i have this problem just now my best solution i can give to you right now despite that you didn t include any of your code would be
check how you name your destination folder eg new_folder sometimes this can cause error for permission as most hosts don t allow names using underscore dash etc to be created at run time
it worked for me
if you were using recursive command to create sub-folders don t forget to put 0777 to the mkdir command eg
this is also worked for me just now
i have an application that starts up and processes queued items
the items are processed at a timer framed rate
this is implemented using the ace_reactor class
the bit of code that kicks this off is
this causes the handle_timeout method to be called which then processes one item off the queue
while there are more items in the queue the callback returns 0
when the queue is empty the callback returns -1 which stops the reactor loop
the problem is that when the method returns -1 run_reactor_event_loop
is still blocking
i d like the application to complete return a status code and exit
i am having a hard time finding good documentation w examples
am i missing something
some things to check
are you sure the sql server service is running
if it is a named instance or on a port other than 1433 is the sql browser service running
are tcp ip and or named pipes enabled under start programs sql server configuration tools sql server configuration manager highlight
if you are using mysql
you could do this
you should correct the order and structure of the tags to make it look like this
try fillling in the dots yourself
make sure you are seeking to the beginning of the file before reading like so
if that doesn t work post your code
textview value is not setting because the value of id may be null
check it
what is the css equivalent for html in adobe flash builder
i understand that adobe flash builder mobile projects use flex and action script to code
however i want to create a style for all of my buttons on the page
how do i do this in an adobe flash builder application
typically in css i would create a css style sheet and place it in the directory of my website then just reference that style sheet into each of the pages or html files
how do implement this same approach with adobe flash builder

you might want to take look at tornadio2 which is tornado+socket.io and implement multiplex connection one to handle to push messages the other is to ping the server so that you can check if the client is still connected or not
the multiplex does not open multiple connections but uses the single connection to virtually connect to different handlers
look at multiplexed.py line 66
the multiplex example is also an sample chat application
this is very easy to do just include this wrapper for the xmlhttprequest at the beginning of your script it makes it easier to use

for example if the reply is

a dialog box appears give your macro a name
b
shortcut key if you want can give by pressing shift and any key such as
letters
c
store macro in this workbook this allows your macro to run on this sheet
click on use relative references
once you are done just perform the delete operation by removing the portion you do not want on one of the column so that the macro may record the process which you are performing
once done below at the lowest pane you will find stop macro option a small blue square box
click it to stop the recording of the macro
now you are ready with a macro to replicate the same without you performing the operation
just goto any other column where you want to perform the operation and click on macro option on the developer tab and then click on your created marco and you will see the magic happen

you should now have a ppp0 interface on both machines
you need a null modem cable between the machines
make sure you use the correct dev entry and speed for the serial port
embedded systems tend to configure a serial port as the kernel console where kernel messages are written and perhaps configure getty for login sessions over serial as well - you might need to find a way to disable those
setting up slip instead of ppp might be an alternative too
since we do not typically have the access required to create .npm we have to find ways of moving the npm cache normally .npm and the npm user configuration normally .npmrc to accessible folders to get things going
the following information comes partially from a bug report that i submitted to redhat on this matter
we must begin by creating an environmental variable to control the location of .npmrc
i created a file with shell access to my application called .env in
within this file i have placed
this moves the .npmrc directory to a place where we have the privileges to read write
naturally i have to also create the directory .npmrc in
then in my pre-start webhook early in my build script i have placed
this ensures that the environmental variable that configures the location of .npmrc will be accessible each time we deploy build
now we can move the location of the npm cache
start by running touch on the .env file manually and create the .npm directory in
run the following to complete the reconfiguration
npm should now be accessible each time we deploy even if we are not using the nodejs cartridge
the above directory choices may be changed as desired

you need to pass your post data in login to check username and password
hope this helps you
if we think about what check must do at a high level we know it must check for every element of samples to see if the test sample3 contains any or all i m unclear which you mean of the strings result are present
so we know we need recursion and we can start by making the general outline of the function
so when the list is empty no matches can occur so we can immediately return false
in the recursive case we know we need to check x and if no match is found continue checking xs
one possible way to do this is with a helper function check you can also just inline the check
ok so what does check do
it checks the datatype sample to see if any matches occur
we know sample has two constructors test1 and test2 so check should look like
the first thing we have to do is test the value of name to see if it matches samplename
we can do this easily using guards
since check is a child function of check the variables defined in check are in scope so we can just refer to them
a new case is added to handle the event that the names do not match
ok so now the idea is to check if any or all of the values in result occur in values
luckily the prelude has a function we can use for this
the function now becomes
the full function is thus
checking every element of a list with a predicate is so common that the prelude has standard functions for this
one possible way to define check is using the functions or and map
this will generally result in a less efficient function though
the function can further be simplified by adapting an alternative structure for the datatype such as
the function then becomes
lastly since the result of check is a bool and guards are bool as well we can refactor check to a simpler form which doesn t need the fallthrough case
this or map
.. pattern is so common that again there s a prelude function any which does this
check can then be further simplified to
if you want to remove all files beginning with a certain extension you can do this
this will remove all files matching that pattern
if you want to do something more than just removing
you can change your loop into
you can just remove the direct descendant
alternatively if you wish to keep the direct descendant then you can have multiple selector rules
this will do it assuming that you can load the data from your first query into a intermediate temporary table
i have regular layout folder which has a navigation drawer which opens and closes
this is built inside a drawer layout with navigation view
i also have a layout-sw720dp-land folder which has an open navigation drawer built inside a linear layout in horizontal orientation with a navigation view
i run it in nexus 5 emulator and it picks up layout 1 for both portrait and landscape orientation
i run it in nexus 10 emulator and i hoped it would pick up layout 2 for landscape mode but it just doesn t budge
i tried sw600dp-land sw840dp-land etc
the only time the second layout gets picked is when i just mention the folder as layout-land
in the code i tried picking up based on drawer layout id it is only present in layout 1
i tried using a values folder with bool resources file
any ideas of where my understanding is going wrong
bottom line i need to pick up layout 2 for tablets in landscape mode
thanks for your help in advance
addition info- when i set the emulator skin to none it seems to work
i am not sure what role does this play
without the emulator does a nexus 10 not behave like a nexus 10
unresponsive script fix
it looks like you re just calling paginateit recursively
the paginateit function does a bunch of work and then calls itself again infinitely
to fix this remove the call to paginateit just below your comment warning unresponsive script comment
here s the simplified structure of your code so that you can see the problem more clearly
re-pagination fix
i would have written this line of code
as this
also you ll want to call paginateit after the animation completes for that to work correctly
you ll probably want to do this in an animation callback but here s a temporary workaround
if you re trying to impress your instructor i would use the memory cache approach
it is significantly faster than the approach sjoerd is describing
consider this implementation
lets compare the two just to prove my point
here s the comparison in runtimes
the runtime is so much higher because the recursive function
generates n 2 recursive calls write it out on paper if that doesn t make sense
on the other hand defining
takes advantage of memory caching to calculate the terms which results in a drastically faster runtime since each call generates a cached value for fib x
alright so i have this beauty of a code that i want to squish into a new method
so far i figured obviously the error reports will be inside the method
however it s not as simple as that because while the grade count is an int the grade itself is a double and calculated under a for loop
many ways i ve tried do not even accept an input from the user
i ve tried looking around for a better example than a simple method format but i have yet to find something similar to my problem
is there a way to put both grade count and actual grade within the method for it to work
i ve tried condensing code within a method before but it was with a much simpler code than this one
i get the idea of methods but actually doing them is confusing
help is super appreciated
you should pass a list of numpy arrays to set as initial weights
for convolution2d weights list have two items one in shape nb_filter nb_channel nb_row nb_col and bias in shape nb_filter
according to the author of keras
if you have doubts about what these shapes are you can simply
instantiate your layer then call get_weights and look at the
output
the argument weights and also the method
set_weights weights expect exactly the same format as the output
of get_weights
two zen of python principles leap to mind
simple is better than complex
there should be one and preferably only one obvious way to do it
range
the python built-in function range start end generates a list from start to end.1 the first element of that list is start and the last element is end - 1
there is no range_strict function or inclusive_range function
this was very awkward to me when i started in python
i just want a list from a to b inclusive
how hard is that guido
however the convention used in calling the range function was simple and easy to remember and the lack of multiple functions made it easy to remember exactly how to generate a range every time
recommendation
as you ve probably guessed my recommendation is to only create a function to test whether i is in the range j k
in fact my recommendation is to keep only your existing inrange function
since your question specifically mentions pythonicity i would recommend you name the function as in_range to better fit with the python style guide.
justification
why is this a good idea
the single function is easy to understand
it is very easy to learn how to use it
of course the same could be said for each of your three starting functions
so far so good
there is only one function to learn
there are not three functions with necessarily similar names
given the similar names and behaviours of your three functions it is somewhat possible that you will at some point use the wrong function
this is compounded by the fact that the functions return the same value except for edge cases which could lead to a hard-to-find off-by-one bug
by only making one function available you know you will not make such a mistake
the function is easy to edit
it is unlikely that you ll need to ever debug or edit such an easy piece of code
however should you need to do so you need only edit this one function
with your original three functions you have to make the same edit in three places
with your revised code in your self-answer the code is made slightly less intuitive by the operator obfuscation
the size of the range is obvious
for a given ring where you would use inrange i j k it is obvious how many elements would be covered by the range j k
here it is in code
so therefore
caveats
i m approaching this problem from a completely generic point of view such as that of a person writing a function for a publicly-released library
since i don t know your problem domain i can t say whether this is a practical solution
using this solution may mean a fair bit of refactoring of the code that calls these functions
look through this code to see if editing it is prohibitively difficult or tedious
1 actually it is
i trust you get what i mean though
the width property for uicomponent works in a different way of its parent class sprite because flex components have a different resizing logic
in example modifing width or height do not affects the graphics layer
if you want to scale your uicomponent and the graphics layer try to use directly the scalex and scaley properties
try this in example if you want to scale by width to 520 and keep the aspect ratio
edit as it turned out i was going completely the wrong way with this
i discovered that when i tried to wire a button to call a method on the controller it still crashed even when that controller action did absolutely nothing
this led me to wonder and i realized in my main window controller i was creating another controller and then moving on with no references to that new controller
so essentially my crash was due to the view controller being deallocated not anything to do with reloading the table or fetching data
i ve solved this by adding a strong property for the child view controller in the main window controller though i m not sure this is 100 the best strategy
driving me slightly batty here.
i m trying to do an afnetworking call and reload an nstable when i get the results
this however crashes with rather unhelpful errors
i am guessing that this is due to a threading issue but various methods i ve tried to avoid this such as using __block haven t helped
i m at a loss as to how to get this to work
here is the hopefully trimmed down relevant code
the error i m getting is thread 1 exc_bad_access code exc_i386_gpflt
any clues
if i skip the reloaddata call then it runs without crashing though obviously shows no data
you could store the numbers and their offsets in separate std vector instances
the only way to find null is to use coalesce customer_search_view.primary_phone is null so you would need to extend your variables to be like
if you can t change your front end you could loop through values before your query such as
it s work for me
try use in watch
in main app
using a csv module might be overkill for this data set but here s a way to do it
added a bit of overkill sorting and counting as well for fun

i have an application written in java that needs to run under another windows user account each time
my question is - is it possible to automatically create and switch windows user accounts using java
for example suppose i create two local user accounts - one called test12 and one called test123 and i m logged in to test123 - i need to be able to switch to test12 and then back to test123 or a different account purely using java
is this possible
how
i understand there are several question on so that address this issue however i ve only seen the question in c# or .net not in java for example the following question is it possible to switch user accounts programmatically
was asked in c# and the question create windows user programmatically c# .net using pricinpaluser createprofile was asked in c#
i am using windows 8 however i wanted the application to be able to run on windows server 12 as well if possible
i try to get an image inside dropdownlist using jquery and it s work fine with me
my code
dropdownlist
and in c#
so everything work fine and i get image inside the list but the problem when i try to lode some webpage use specific javascript or jquery it will give me an error message
one page have jquery with javascript display this error object doesn t support property or methode msdropdown
another page i only use javascript in it it will close and display this message 0x800a1391 - javascript runtime error is undefined
and there other problems if there some action in some page image will hided
could any one help me in that
thanks
here are two likely reasons for this error
you have put implementation cipher in a header file probably the cipher.h header file and you ve imported that header file in both caesarshiftviewcontroller.m and caesarshiftappdelegate.m
an implementation statement goes in a .m file not a .h file
you have accidentally imported cipher.m in both caesarshiftviewcontroller.m and caesarshiftappdelegate.m
you were supposed to import cipher.h notice the suffix

as hachiethan pointed out in a comment you might have imported cipher.m in your caeser shift-prefix.pch file in the supporting files group
this file is automatically imported by all .m files so it would have the same effect as my #2 above
my application ingests data from a 3rd party rest api which is backed by dynamodb
the results are paginated and thus i page forward by passing the last evaluated key to each subsequent request
my question is does the last evaluated key have a shelf life
does it ever expire
let s say i query the rest api and then decide to stop
if i save the last evaluated key can pick up exactly where i left off 30 days later
would that last evaluated key still work and return the correct next page based on where i left off previously
i had similar requirement - at specific period to prevent the controls from hiding and here is my solution
in the control template for the transport controls i created additional visual state in the controlpanelvisibilitystates group called controlpanelvisible state where the controls are visible
when i needed to prevent the transport controls from hiding i made a dispatchertimer to call this visual state every 10 ms
keeptransportcontrolsvisibletimer new dispatchertimer
keeptransportcontrolsvisibletimer.interval timespan.frommilliseconds 10
keeptransportcontrolsvisibletimer.tick + obj args

visualstatemanager.gotostate this controlpanelvisible true

keeptransportcontrolsvisibletimer.start
this prevented the controls from auto hiding
i basically have a table with a column

i need the results to be dog -3 the - 2 i - 2
i cant post images so i cannot post a table
i have the following mapping in elasticsearch 2.2
i am using php to add to the index with elastiquent5
my toarray is
when i try to add the item to the index i get the following error
in json format it yields correctly in php array it is
if i manually json_encode this and use the curl -xput
it goes through - however the php doesnt
any idea where i went wrong
clarification
my goal is to insert the coordinate that my model data is extracting to map to the location field inside the index since i already designed as a geo_point type as defined by my mapping
i do not want to designate a new field in order to solve this
secondary note as i mentioned doing a put with the json will yield successfully however not as a php object out with the php drivers for elastic search which yielded the error when it tried to create the document
because it s overridable
make it private or final
the warning isn t complaining that you did override a method
it s complaining that someone else could
which is bad for ctors since then your ctor will call a method that does god-knows-what
usually methods called from the ctor are private
sometimes you want them public so make them final too if they are public
edit re
your question i noticed it doesn t matter where you place final in the methods signature for example public final void dotests or final public void dotests
is there a preferred way

yes there is
the java language specification says the preferred order is
annotations
public protected or private
abstract static final synchronized native strictfp
your object is created and setup only once when it is called
it doesn t access the apitoken variable every time you make a call to one of its functions
in order to make the code above work you would have to call settoken before you call authors because once you call authors the object is created and will use the value of apitoken at that moment
i don t know of any way to do what you want and still use the service
you might have to just use the service directly like you re doing for your authenticator function
or something like that
hope that helps
you can add this line to .ideavimrc

there are two restrictions why this is impossible now
any sqlite database is stored inside a particular path
data data databases
to get access to any database you have to use a path
you can only get data from assets or raw in order to copy to somewhere
this is not possible to manipulate with sqlite without namely file data
that s why you have to copy data from app resourses into filesystem
imho this is ugly but i had not found another solution
android default api realm uses it use only the files stored in databases folder
two letter high-level domains such as .lt and .tt belong to individual countries
.lt is lithuania and .tt is trinidad and tobago
to get domains under these high-level country domains just google for the domain name registrar for that country and register it just like you do a .com .net .org etc

i would like to get metadata about the current video
the video is ready to provide the data using player.getvideodata but the author is empty
player.getvideodata returns
if i look at the player object itself the metadata is available in player.b.videodata as
i m only able to find limited info about the video metadata in the api docs or google
the result is the same across multiple browsers
is the another way to be the author or more metadata using the iframe player api
did some extra tests
it seems the author is somehow added later
player.b.videodata.author is also empty when i call player.getvideodata
the docs
calling player.getvideodata a few seconds later will provide a none empty author

i am trying to create a many to many relationship between 2 tables
ive got 3 tables for that
it follows toxy model

table ab ab.a_id foreign key ab.b_id foreign key
table b b.id primary key
how should i insert the data so it will be all linked up
like this
insert into a name values my name
then like this
insert into b name values my name
but then i have to have the a.id and b.id to put it in table ab
how should i retrieve them
i know i could do a select a.id from a where name my name
but isnt there an easier way for this that automatically returns an id when u insert the row

a project i am working on utilizes elasticsearch as a search engine
i also am using a graph database to keep track of user actions and the relationships between queries clicks etc

is this possible in elasticsearch itself
or do i need to do the boosting externally

you can do most things in asp.net using fairly pure c#
early on i relied heavily on the asp.net controls dragging and dropping most of my pages with little snippets of code here and there to make controls do what i wanted
i really didn t like it and it make me think of coding asp.net as a completely distinct thing from c# programming ok it was vb at the time- don t judge me

now almost all of my code- and html generation is handled by various custom classes
my code-behind pages simply connect the page specific inputs and event to my utillity classes
likewise i use inline code for output- i simply invoke a function on my code behind that gathers the necessary variable and lets my classes do the heavy lifting
i definitely find that some of the asp.net specific controls are useful and i do use them from time to time
i did however find that changing the way i put my code together gave me a whole different idea of the language

i m working on an app that is built on sencha touch 2.3.1 and cordova 3.5.1
i have this app working on really any other android device i ve tested on except for the newest fire hd devices from amazon and in my case a fire hd 6
when i build the apk sign it zipalign it etc
and then post it online for download to the device i m seeing an issue of a grey screen only when starting in portrait
here is the screenshot
when i start in landscape mode i get this screenshot
the crazier part is that when i start the app in portrait grey screen rotate to landscape no change and then rotate back to portrait close the app and reopen it the correct portrait screen is shown here
in contrast to the signed apk when i build the app for testing in eclipse and deploy to the device the app works as expected
the only difference i can discern between the eclipse version and the signed apk is the way that the cordova jar file is included in the project
here is the log file from the fire hd 6 when i build from eclipse
unfortunately even after trying a quick google search i don t know a way of grabbing logs from the fire hd 6 when the signed apk runs
does anyone have any idea about finding those logs on the device
here is the logcat from the sideloaded apk
finally does anyone have any idea why i m seeing this bug
or any ideas if building the cordova jar differently would introduce this bug
or why the fire hds are the only devices that have the issue
or if this is a sencha touch cordova issue on fire hds
or does anyone have any ideas for troubleshooting - i ve run out of try this next scenarios
thanks for reading and any help you provide i do appreciate it

buddy you are doing few blunders like you have defined int variables as sunday monday tuesday....

break
similarly enter all days in case

i m trying to automate a webpage that includes a lot of javascript functions in perl
so far i ve been successful by using the headless mechanize phantomjs toolkit but i can t get past this probably trivial error
i see a page with a menu of radio buttons and when i try to select any one of those using
where i is my iterator and booking_choice is the name of the button i get the error listed below
this is how it looks on the page
there are two other radio buttons with values 0 and 2 and that s what the iterator is for
however within any one iteration upon selection of the button i get the following error
i can locate the button on the page fine by using xpath and it always returns success
what i don t understand is
why the element is no longer accessible even when i can see it listed on the html source page
how can i keep the element intact so that it is available for selection
i m very new to webscraping web automation and i found some similar question to mine on this forum but they are either written for ruby or use some other webdriver than phantomjs
i don t know how to implement any of the given solutions using mechanize phantomjs
i ll appreciate any help i can get

i ve placed the source html file here
my app uses several handles all intptr s of varying type
i want to help ensure that the correct handle type are passed to my various methods.
if i used intptr for them all then there s no hint that the method takes handle type a or handle type b
if l were in c++ land i could use typedefs
and now i have two types hdla and hdlb both of which are generic u32 s under the hood
in c++ i could also use a macro to declare the structs
additionally for marshaling reasons i need these to be value types.
can t use a class naturally if i could use class that would solve everything
all handles have essentially identical definitions
i certainly can do this longhand - i can declare 5 or 6 identical blocks of code where only the struct names vary - but that s not very elegant
i ve considered using an interface but that disallows member fields so no luck there
what i d love is to have a base struct then have hdla hdlb etc simply derive off the base
but c# disallows base types in structs
this seems like something that should have an easy and elegant solution but it s escaping me
any ideas

python docs say that it is a length modifier
a length modifier h l or l may be present but is ignored as it is not necessary for python
so e.g
ld is identical to d
they seem the same
the spec doesn t explicitly allow direct non-password-based exchange of user tokens between a client and the auth server directly
i think it would be quite natural to extend the password grant to other forms of authentication though
it s in the spirit of the spec if not by the letter so if you own both sides of the relationship there isn t much to go wrong
spring oauth doesn t explictly support anything that extends the password grant in this way but its not hard to do it s really just about the security of the token endpoint
an alternative approach i ve seen is to stick to the password grant protocol but make the password a one-time token that the client can only get by knowing the user has authenticated in one of those alternative ways

when a process calls io format and similar functions the process sends io request messages to its group_leader process
so a simple hack is to open a file and set it as the group_leader of the processes producing the output
here is an example of redirecting the shell process s output to a file
this will only redirect the current shell process so you will have to set the group_leader for all processes which you would like to redirect to the file
the solution can be refined of course for example by spawning a server process which proxies io request messages to rotated files etc

it always uses 31s as the green phase duration changeable using option --tls.green-time and 6s for left turn phases
the yellow time is computed based on the minimum deceleration and there isn t even an all-red phase
so in short you won t do much worse by pulling a number out of a hat

question
i want to use ninject ver 3 for di
1 do i need to add ninject in each of my layer project level to resolve the di
in which layer should i add the following code to create the bindings
as the following code goes into the ninjectwebcommon.cs class for binding
2 do i need to add ninject in each project layer of my solution and define the bindings in each ninjectwebcommon.cs class
or the binging should only be defined in the wcf layer but then i will need to add the referance of each of my projects in wcf project
or the binging should only be defined in the start of mvc layer but then i will need to add the referance of each of my projects in my mvc project
please advice
many thanks
if you can point me to any sample working code with all the above layers and ninject that would be great
i tried but cannot find any thing like this

i have a branch mainbranch which is recently derived from the master
if a do a git pull origin otherbranch will that merge the branch otherbranch to the mainbranch derived from master
git merge can be used but curious to know what will the above statement do
what i need is to merge otherbranch with main branch and megre is giving error
thanks for the help everything finally got it working by using 2 parentelements
can you please be a bit more specific with your question in particular where in the code does the error occur
with the survratemissingna.dat are there any headers on it or does it appear exactly as you posted it
if there are no headers this line of code will give you an error straight away
that line is reading data from the data.frame x which contains the survratemissingna.dat data
if that data file has no headers then outcome01 does not exist
not does survrate gsi avoid orintrus
to fix this initial error make sure that the file contains headings

i remember this one from ms-dos days
i don t know if anyone has reimplemented it for windows
i m not sure where the 400 is coming from but the exception that is thrown is the same is in your verbose example 1004 - method range of object _worksheet failed and is thrown for the same reason
the problem is how you re addressing the range
cells 1 1 is implicitly set to the active worksheet not whatever range you are passing it to as a parameter
since you only need one cell you can just use the .cells property instead
if you need to copy more than one cell you ll have to either grab a reference to a worksheets instead of inlining the calls to getfirstworksheetcontainsname if you use dynamic ranges
or hard code it
i have a question about xml-free configuration of spring
unfortunately it does not roll back my db changes even if i mark a corresponding method with transactional annotation
first of all i have a controller which calls a class marked with transactional
all controllers have an exceptionresolver that catches duplicatekeyexception
here is my main transactional class which calls two dao classes
the second one causes duplicatekeyexception but the results of the first one are not deleted from db
i tried also to use transactional annotation both for the classes daoclass1 and daoclass2 but it did not change anything
what could i have done wrong
popup1.php
popup2.php
my problem is after clicking the popup is not closing and the parent page in not refresh wht is right
is when i click the button submit in the popup it will close then refresh the parent page popup1.php thank you d
doing ajax calls is a concept that is originated from the client side and you are in the server so you don t have the xmlhttprequest function available on node.js
so to make a http request from node.js you could use
you could reformat your question better with the code tool
however it looks like you could approach the problem in this way to avoid all those func expressions floating around
is there any good reason to do what you are doing
in general this is quite dangerous pattern in python
in your case
you are binding an instance of b to the class a which means that every instance of class a will share the same instance of class b
it s a case you must then handle properly
in general you don t want this if you want each instance of a to be related to an instance of b you must make the assignment inside __init__
in these case it doesn t meter where class b is defined since it s instantiated at run time
again beware that the semantic is very different in the two cases if you know java the former is more like defining a static attribute
about
and i know that in c there is function declaration
you shouldn t make too much parallels with a language like c which is very different on many aspects most important it s a compiled language that means that you code is parsed in it whole before being translated to machine language that s why you can make function declaration and have your namespace populated regardless of the order you define things
python is an interpreted language which means basically that each statement is translated when it s called and a class declaration is called when the module is imported
so to recap if you really need a class bound instance you have to declare class b before class a else you must instantiate b inside __init__ then you can declare b wherever you want since it s called at runtime
jean-fran ois corbett s answer is perfect
to be exhaustive i would just like to add that with some restrictons you could also use usedrange.columns.count or usedrange.rows.count

you possibly need to increase your thread pool size
by default tests run in dev mode and dev mode has a thread pool size of 1
look for this line in your application.conf
play.pool 1
see if increasing that value will help
if you take a look at the help of quadl and quadv you see that quadl uses a different algorithm to integrate the function
numerical analysis almost never yields perfect results so you cannot expect to get identical results
i have an app on both android and ios which allows the user to put appointments on their calendar
currently for both platforms i m simply adding the appointment to the default calendar

now however i need to add multiple user support for the app and have their events kept separate
i am looking for a way to sync the calendar events between my app on both platforms
how do i reliably retrieve calendar events across devices

just when i think i m getting a grasp on angularjs it throws me overboard
i am trying to have a value in the parent scope be updated by passing it through to an isolated scope and then update it there
i thought with two way data binding this would be as simple as the following
in parent controller
in element
in the child directive
now if inside that function i call a console.log on the scope.variable it displays the correct value of updatedval
however on the page itself the parent hasn t been updated
is there some sort of refresh i need to call
i thought the point of angularjs was that two-way data binding was baked in and i wouldn t have to ask it to update values based on later logic
a colleague has used a broadcast but is there not a more elegant sollution

run your page through the html validator and fix all errors
without valid html browsers don t know for sure what you intended to display and you ll have cross-browser rendering inconsistency

edit
op s site previously contained malformed html including open tags and misplaced tags
op s site has since been fixed rendering the code at the url posted in the question obsolete
edit 2
i m seeing the op s issues in chrome
i cannot explain why the issue was occurring or why it was intermittent
however i fixed it by adding the following..
additional css
existing html
this takes the two main header elements and floats them left right respectively
the right one was already floating to the right
overflow auto
is a trick to force the header to expand to contain it s floated elements
since both are floated they are outside the regular content flow and would not normally cause the header to expand
yes depending on the complexity of your html
actually when you have html in your jlabel the basiclabelui uses a view to paint the label instead of simple paint logic
now you can check various different implementations of view class to check how it affects you
you can read the code of basiclabelui.paint for clarity
but for simple decorated html i don t think you need to worry at all
you should update your adt bundle and window- androidsdkmanager- download all api level and try to do again
if you need to impersonate the named pipe client s security credentials there s really only one option and named pipes also have nicer names although dns srv records can provide those for tcp ports also
otherwise there s not much difference
both treat the data as a stream of bytes leaving you responsible for finding message boundaries yourself
named pipes have an additional option of keeping message boundaries for you but be warned you must both create the pipe in message mode and explicitly set the read mode as well
i believe you can get to the methods at least in scala 2.11.x also if you haven t heard of it you should checkout the neophyte s guide to scala part 1 extractors
the whole 16 part series is fantastic but part 1 deals with case classes pattern matching and extractors which is what i think you are after
also i get that java.lang.string complaint in intellij as well it defaults to that for reasons that are not entirely clear to me i was able to work around it by explicitly setting the type in the typical postfix style i.e
_ string
there must be some way to work around that though
update
so after seeing a few of the other answers i was curious if there was any performance differences between them
so i set up what i think might be a reasonable test using an array of 1 000 000 random string tuples and each implementation is run 100 times
assuming my test is sound it seems the unapply in a companion-ish object was 2x faster than the pattern matching and pattern matching another 1.5x faster than two maps
each implementation probably has its use cases limitations
i d appreciate if anyone sees anything glaringly dumb in my testing strategy to let me know about it and sorry about that var
thanks
i am new to android and i am stuck
the basic premise for me is when an app is opened i need to prompt the user to switch on the bluetooth
and when yes is pressed i need to begin scanning for nearby devices automatically
one more premise is that i should not use any buttons to start scanning
it should start automatically when the bluetooth is switched on
the code has no syntax errors
am i doing something wrong logically
because when i run the app nothing happens
it does prompt to establish bluetooth connection but after switch on it should automatically scan and populate the listview in the activity_main file
which is not happening
the activity_main.xml
the mainactivity.java
the androidmanifest.xml
came across this article while i was searching for a solution of my own
needed a non-intrusive way to keep people from entering anything by numbers in one field and nothing but letters numbers or spaces in other fields
i couldn t use pattern 9999 for the numbers as it was not a required field and folks get yelled at if they tab through that field
likewise could not use pattern xxx for the alpha numeric fields as i also needed to allow spaces
leapfrogging from this article and using javascript that previous programmers had developed for that client i came up with these beautiful handlers thought i d share in case someone else needed this elegant solution and also because sometimes i forget and would be able to find this again
either in a .js file you include or enclosed in tags
then your input or cfinput fields would have or in their attributes
as people type if they enter an invalid character this script will kick in and simply remove that bad character
no extra buttons to click or alerts to dismiss

hi i m using emeditor because i have huge log files and it handles them quite well
the question is.
is there a way for me to find any line the has a specific word and create copy just that line to a new file
the other way to do this this would be to find every line that does not have a specific word and delete that line
reason the log files are huge and i only need to look at a log of say one folder or page on the site
you can set a textview s inputtype to one of the values from inputtype to hint that the typed-in text should be a person s name phone number c
even if the input method doesn t respect this hint the textview uses a keylistener and or transformationmethod to ensure that only relevant characters can be entered or to have effects like masking the password
even the flags are more than just hints they can change the behaviour of the textview significantly the most obvious example being editorinfo.type_text_flag_multi_line
google s documentation is very vague about the actual effect of each inputtype
what characters are actually permitted in each case
how does this vary by locale if at all
even if there is no documented answer and it s liable to change between versions i d still like to know the expected behaviour
it s a rvm bug

in some class of android source code they import com.android.mms.r but i can t do it after i tryied
are there any methods be used to import com.android.mms.r
is too large for stack declare it as a global variable
i have drawn a text on the canvas in coordinates x y and saved them
i have a simple method that checks if a mouse click has happened inside the text boundaries
the problem is when i rotate the text 45 degree i cannot check whether a mouse click has happened within the rotated text or not
in short how can i check whether a mouse click is inside a rotated text or shape
i think as long as you don t use them as datanodes your wouldn t have an issue .
of course the data locality aspect of hadoop is gone at that point
if i get it right you want to display the sum of the values of all -fields

i ve been attempting to install nativescript with angular with this tutorial for the past two days and i keep running into problems surrounding the android sdk not installing correctly and freezing and finally re-installing the latest jdk and jve before attempting to install android studio
as i researched the problem i think i found the culprit
when i run javac -version i keep getting an older version of jdk it states javac 1.6.0_45 however i have the latest version of jdk 1.8.0_102
i researched the problem but only found either complex solutions invilving the variable path or mac solutions
what can i do to update the jdk when i run javac -version
user variables path
system variables path
note i m a complete noob at playing around with the windows path and i don t really know anything about the environment variable but i see that the paths of certain applications that i have installed all appear in the system variables python node ruby angularjs2 androidsdk
that being said if anyone can me some guidance on the uses best practice and differences between user variable and system variable that will be an added bonus
and please give me instructions like i m a complete beginner when it comes to messing around with the path

you could use some linq syntax to get to your xml
start off with a new using
then you can write a linq query to open your xml file

then do something with the result

this sounds like multiple instances of the activity are being created started which is expected default behaviour when calling .startactivity check out the docs tasks and back stack

you encoded it wrongly because of non-ascii symbols rezepte.json should look like

first of all note that the exception s stack trace is usually printed to the stderr stream of the process while you write to the stdout
often stderr is redirected to stdout but this is not required
another thing to consider is that the documentation doesn t state anything about the concurrent access of printstream#println so the output when two threads try to print at the same time is truly umpredictable
given that it doesn t make much sense to have the exception stack trace in the game because it s another stream altogether the problem is reduced to which between the main thread and the other one writes first
not only this is up to the jvm scheduler but also consider that the method is not synchronized so it could even print an interleaved string well i don t think this will ever happen in reality but this is what may happen
i am using opencv to process some videos where a user is placing their hands on different parts of a wall
i ve selected some regions of interest and i m currently just using cv2.absdiff on the original image of the wall with no user and the current frame to detect whether the user has their hand in a region of interest by looking at the average pixel difference
if it s above some threshold i consider that region activated
the problem i m having is that some of the video clips contain lighting and positions that result in the user casting a shadow over certain rois such that they are above the threshold
is there a good way to filter out shadows when diffing images

for a polygon use .containslocation clickedlatlng polygon when it returns true the click has been on the polygon

i m looking to make a mobile app in .net for tracking bus locations assuming the bus location data comes from an external source
i come from a more traditional .net web dev background - for example i ve worked on pulling weather data from an api caching it etc
my question is around how to approach development of an app like this where its more about pushing updates to the client rather than having it tied to a specific request
my thinking
1 create an api which calls the external bus gps service for current coordinates on all buses say every 5 seconds
2 the api then pushes those results to all clients
alternatively it simply caches the result and then i would have the clients request from the api that is i m trying to avoid hammering the external gps service
as i m thinking in .net would i use signalr for this
how would i architect the layers in mobile environment
trying to make sure i take the right approach never built a mobile app before..
i suggest to print out the type of your a_name and see what it says
my guess is that your usage of input does not yield what you expect
try raw_input instead
the python course has the following to say on input
the input of the user will be interpreted
if the user e.g
puts in an
integer value the input function returns this integer value
if the
user on the other hand inputs a list the function will return a list
that means that if you want a string e.g
q you have to enter literally q
you may want your input to be takes as a string no matter what you type and leave interpretation up to your implementation
then you better call raw_input
i ve got a single meta variable with a string value that should always be 0 or 1 being stored on pages
i can set it using a simple dropdown box in a metabox and it seems to work great

i have no clue why and it seems to happen even on a page i wasn t editing or updating
i m baffled and don t even know where to begin looking because i haven t figured out how to replicate the problem
does anyone have any suggestions to search for a possible way to replicate this or figure out the cause
this is what i am talking about
i would imagine if this is possible system.reflection will be utilized

it is use django-facebookconnect
on ios every uiview is backed by a core animation calayer so you are dealing with calayers when using a uiview even though you may not realize it
unlike nsviews on the mac which evolved before core animation existed uiviews are intended to be lightweight wrappers around these calayers
as i describe in the similar question when to use calayer on the mac iphone
working directly with calayers doesn t give you significant performance advantages over uiviews
one of the reasons you might want to build a user interface element with calayers instead of uiviews is that it can be very easily ported to the mac
uiviews are very different from nsviews but calayers are almost identical on the two platforms
this is why the core plot framework lays out its graphs using calayers instead of other ui elements
one thing uiviews provide over calayers is built-in support for user interaction
they handle hit-testing on touches and other related actions that you would need to build yourself if managing a hierarchy of calayers
it s not that hard to implement this yourself but it is extra code you d need to write when building a calayer-only interface
you will often need to access the underlying layers for a uiview when performing more complex animations than the base uiview class allows
uiview s animation capabilities have grown as the ios sdk has matured but there are still a few things that are best done by interacting with the underlying calayer
you clould implement .on method that way
a solution would be to add a method on your abstract player class and implement that differently in your derived types of player
for example
this example is showing the you have a base class that asks any inherited classes to implement the methods defined as abstract
in this case count

i haven t used selectlist before but a quick glance and some quick jsfiddle work i borrowed one of the selectlist examples at it makes it look like adding a delegated event handler to the selectlist classed ul should be able to take care of it
one caveat the easiest way to do this for selection is to put the .delete span inside the appropriate li
personally i think it s also the closest to being semantically correct since that delete belongs to that particular li
there are a couple of different ways to handle an approach where the deletes are outside of the li and that shouldn t be terribly hard to figure out but this was faster to reach a working demonstration for me
basically selectlist has a specific remove value function which then removes both the element and de-selects it within the list you just have to go back to your selectlist element and call that remove function using the value of the item being removed which selectlist stores via data as value
i also removed your insertafter as it seems completely unnecessary
note the change to append in the onadd function
if your .delete span has to be in a following rather than contained element you will either need to use sibling selectors or attach the data to the span as well when it is created or use some similar method
note if you re creating your selectlists on the fly you will need to attach the .on to something containing them and probably change the selector to .selectlist-item .delete to keep it specific

i have a small class what i made thread safe with the synchronization attribute it also implements the contextboundobject interface
i d like to make this class serializable
the code compiles but i receive an
exception
i knew that classes marked with synchronization are accessed through some remote proxy but i hoped the default serialization mechanism will work
this is a small app the class is just an in-memory sequence integer id generator so no real remoting is done
i guess i can synchronize by other means lock keyword but i d like to know what is the standard solution for this problem

i typed users instead of users
so i fixed the rb file in db migrate directory and tried to run it again only to find migration is already partially proceeded and i cannot redo it over again
it seems like it s a common error by beginner like me and the instructor presented two solution for this first drop the table in sql or second comment out the already-run part and run the leftover
but before i found the trouble-shooting advice i thought i can just use different file name sigh and i changed the users to admin_user and admin_user to admin_user2
i didn t work and i dropped the table and did
rails generate migration alterusers
and

but it aborted again because it cannot find this file users.frm
i have no idea where .frm files are..

private methods shouldn t be tested
because you write private methods to support your public methods thus testing your public methods indirectly tests the private methods which support them
the principle private methods shouldn t be tested is supported by the principle when you need to test private methods it probably means that you should move those methods to the separate class thus making them public

i can find the missing dates for each clientid by creating a temp table with all possible dates for the period and then joining that to each clientid and dt and only selecting where there is a null
this is what i can get easily for the date range 5 1 14 to 5 4 14
however i want to group each consecutive missed period together and get the beginning of each period and the length
for example if i use the date range 5 1 14 to 5 4 14 i d like to get

in a view im repating the same form and posting it via ajax my concern is the ajax is working for 1st form but not working from second form below is the code im using
a scanned image contains 96 barcodes
there is an example below
to read barcodes i use library from inliteresearch.com
if one or more barcodes are missing in image i.e it contains less than 96 barcodes in other words there is a blank space instead of a barcode how can i read barcodes continuously and return null if a barcode does not exist in image
example barcode 65 is missing
return all barcodes values from 1 to 64 then null for 65 then values from 66 to 96

i wondered how you would go about creating n objects at compile time with templates
or this was indeed even good practise
i have a header file containing some constants
then a header file containing a template which will be generate n times
the part i m a little unsure about is i have
i currently get the error
but since it s in the constructor it ll generate this after compiling anyway
so really i was just wondering how i should be going about this instead
if there was some kind of clever recursive trick i could pull to create these objects for me at compile time
the socket variable is only available within io.sockets.on connection callback function so you can t use it in other files this easily
but you can pass the socket variable to the function where you are trying to use it like this
and change the definition of removeuser to accept the socket as an argument
the same goes for nicknames variable use it like this
and change the function to accept those arguments
try this
check it live
no the compiler generates them
i created the file a.java
then
and running javap -c a to see the content

the result is
it s identical

edit in fact the same bytecode alone doesn t guarantee that the information is not present as metadata
using an hex editor and this program was possible to see that there are two bytes differing and correspond to the line numbers used for printing stack traces so the information is absent in this case

your query seems to be an analytical query to make some analysis based on large amount of data as it contains an aggregation function and a group by clause
to improve performance on such queries you can create a materialized view result of then join with somethink like
by doing that the next query will be much more efficient as mysql will only have to calculate the aggregation
you will then just have to implement a strategy to refresh the table via a timestamp for example
another solution is to import your data in a dbms which is built to be efficient on this kind of querires column oriented databases
for example infinidb which is an open source dbms based on mysql with a storage engine optimized for analytical queries
how about first emptying the array like so

then open the file as utf and write your content there
i can t see any error on your alter statement
the main reason is that maybe there are already records existed on table2 which bus_id are not on table1
so the best solution you can do is to empty first table2 and run the alter statement again
the above answer is excellent but it took me a while to grok it so i offer a slight rewrite which i hope brings clarity to others faster
note that originaltable
is not required - only the field used for the final join
my example assumes the field to be updated is called sequence perhaps clearer in intent than order but mainly sidesteps the reserved keyword issue
what took me a while to get was that const in the original answer was not a mysql keyword
i m never a fan of abbreviations for that reason -- the can be interpreted many ways at times especially at these very when it is best they not be misinterpreted
makes for verbose code i know but clarity always trumps convenience in my books.
not quite sure what the select newvalue 0 is for but i think this is a side effect of having to express a variable before it can be used later on
the value of this update is of course an atomic update to all the rows in question rather than doing a data pull and updating single rows one by one pragmatically
my next question which should not be difficult to ascertain but i ve learned that sql can be a trick beast at the best of times is to see if this can be safely done on a subset of data
where some originaltable.parentid is a set value
in order to center wrapper div it has to have some width and height set without that browser have no idea how to position the wrapper element

your question has a series of definitional problems
for dynamic binding you could be thinking of
function overloading c++
vtable dispatch c++
dynamic name lookup and class dispatch smalltalk ruby python etc
dynamic name lookup and object dispatch javascript
late binding vb6 com
dynamic dispatch lisp dylan
for compiled versus interpreted you could be thinking of
compiled to machine code c c++
compiled to bytecode then jit compiled c# java
compiled to bytecode with vm java python
parsed and tokenised

in general very few languages are compiled to machine code and most of those do not have dynamic name lookup or object inheritance
many languages are compiled but not to machine code and many of them have dynamic name lookup with either class or object inheritance
so the answer is it depends
to use a basic arrayadapter you just need to initialize the adapter and attach the adapter to the listview
first we initialize the adapter
the arrayadapter requires a declaration of the type of the item to be converted to a view a string in this case and then accepts three arguments context activity instance xml item layout and the array of data
note that we ve chosen simple_list_item_1.xml which is a simple textview as the layout for each of the items
now we just need to connect this adapter to a listview to be populated
i hope it helps
my original code wasn t using the correct format for naming names ...but i couldn t debug that as i was also missing a random comma right above button
i m posting the working code
the problem is here
here you assign -1 if the condition fits
however afterwards you do this
which will check if the new value is less 0.4 which it apparently is now
furthermore when your input is greater than 0.4 it should return 1 if i understand you correctly
write this instead
you can use a typed dataset instead of your own object
this allows you to fill a dataset easily but also have strongly typed columns and the ability to access each property easily within a row
go to the add new item window of visual studio and add a dataset
add a new table using the designer and add the columns that are being returned from your sql query
go to the properties window on each column and specify the type int string etc
from there when you re loading the dataset create a new object of your dataset type and fill it like you were before
with a typed dataset there is a property for each table item you created in the designer
by default i believe it is named table1

now when accessing your data you can do
or in a foreach
this isn t quite as good as getting a list of your object back but it s almost there
if you want a list of your own object you ll most likely need to use an object relational mapper such as entity framework or nhibernate
this is probably a very easy question

i have a datagrid getting bound to a dataset and i want to display the average result in the footer for a column populated with integers
the way i figure there s 2 ways i can think of
1. use the source luke
in the code where i m calling datagrid.databind use the datatable.compute method or in my case dataset.datatable 0 .compute
for example
but once i have this how can i insert it into the footer
2. bound for glory
using the datagrid.itemdatabound event and calculating a running total from every listitemtype.item and listitemtype.alternatingitem finally displaying in listitemtype.footer
for example
this just feels wrong plus i would have to make sure the runningtotal is reset on every databind
is there a better way

my guess is you re including the chart uri component already in the project-level ie root urlconf so including it again the app s urlconf is throwing off the resolver

i have the integerupdown from the wpf toolkit and like to bind this to auto generated collection entitycollection from the entity-framework
my intention i have this updown-control to change the number of items in the collection
i was able to use a converter to display the count at the integerupdown but not to change the number of items in the collection because i had no control over the collection at convertback -function - using a ivalueconverter interface
edit
however i cannot use a converter to solve this problem accurately
because in convertback the collection from the model will be overrided with the modified from converter class
this is not possible in ef
i have to use the model from the ef directly modifying the items
the inputview attribute is to assign picker view to textfield s first responder
it won t display pickerview
therefore should be moved to viewdidload

the code below for this function should work as you expect
since you are dealing with a matrix of numbers abs and will be fast
edit if you need to allow for na s just use the na.rm argument in rowsums
example
i assume it s because one of posting or judge is null
if that s not the case you could try turning on sql logging although i m not sure if that happens before or after the code that throws the exception
adding this to the log4j section in config.groovy will log the sql
and this will log the bind parameters
edit 9 4 i spent some time in the debugger with your test code and it s due to the one-to-one mapping between posting and assessment
a one-to-one uses the same value for the primary key as the foreign key of the owner so there s logic in the preparedstatement population code that skips the call to set the value of the 1st arg and doesn t increment the position counter so the one value that s set is the 2nd arg s value in the 1st slot and nothing in the 2nd
you can see from the log4j output that hsqldb does the same thing but it s apparently less strict
note that hsqldb only coincidentally works since you only create one instance of each so they share the same value of the id - if you create some dummy instances of one type first to force a mismatch you ll get the wrong results but not an exception
my suggestion is to rework it as a one-to-many and if you need to you can add a constraint that limits the size of the collection to at most one e.g
children size 0..1 - see
new to caching in general and am enjoying the ehcache 2.4 user s manual i couldn t find 2.5
right off the bat there are some fundamental concepts that i m just not finding the answer to anywhere in the manual or their website
why should there ever be any more than 1 cache for an application
are cache s like log4j loggers where each class in your application should get its own logger
using ehcache lingo what s the difference between a cache and an ehcache
here s a fun one how do you pronounce ehcache
ay-cache
ee-cache
thanks in advance
give position absolute to your .item div
write like this
the first iterates through s1
yes you are right
the above for loop checks whether the substring s2 is present in s1 starting from s1 i
if it matches s2 is completely iterated
if not at the end of the for loop s2 j will not be null character
example if s1 iterate and s2 rat then the loop will execute completely only when i 3
so the holds then it means we have found a substring and i is the starting point of the substring in s1
the abov block removes the substring
so for the iterate and rat example this is done by copying e and null char at positions where r and a were present
the for loop achieves this
if s2 j is not null after for loop the i is incremented to check for substribng from the next position of s1

seems that no one is noticing you
so i give you something to get along with - i tried it out and it seems that jplist might be unbinding your click events from those .row class div s and all under it - when its initialized sorted or what so ever
it provided also redraw_callback event but it fired only once when page had been loaded what a shame because it could be used to attach your own .row click events after initialization
to demonstrate something like redraw_callback setclickevents
where setclickevents
would be method which contains code similar to yours where you call marker click
but since it didnt work
- i see at least few possibilities
1. good way try another plugin - since i already hate jplist for doing those unbindings or..
2. hacker way add javascript click handlers to div while not using jquery and write a bit javascript to top of the page to call clicks for markers which are put inside array when map is initialized
try out this fiddle tested to work with moz and chrome.
notice that i would still choose either good way or consulting plugin maker how redraw_callback works or is it broken etc etc

1 how do i integrate documentation into your agile workflow to increase efficiency and comprehension in your projects
by documentation i m thinking business-oriented documentation and how-tos not source code documentation
i m thinking of a company i used to work for that had a very short template document for project kick-off meetings
the customer inside our company had to complete one of these documents to initiate a project
the template covered all the things we might need to do
it didn t ask for all the answers or commit people to solutions - it was just to prompt people to think about all the things we know that might affect projects of the kind that we did
it covered things like
which functions of our existing code do the clients need
what new custom things does the customer need
prompts to get the internal customer to involve all the people that might be needed to get things done - e.g
networking people the cto for expenditures and policies devs mis for infrastructure changes the dba for corporate reporting-type work because we mostly did our own dbaing inside the apps
an idea of timescales for different pieces of the project
we generally tried to do only the documentation that was specifically needed
in particular we preferred auto-generated technical documentation such as
javadoc for publishing apis
junit-based tests for descriptions of behaviour of components
today i d include bdd frameworks e.g
jbehave cucumber concordion fitnesse... that all help create executable documents that describe what the system does in clear customer-level acceptance tests
2 how do i integrate this with other tools
we used a wiki for the bulk of documentation - because of the difficulty of versioning and sharing word documents around the world between teams
we ran a follow-the-sun distributed xp model with three different teams sharing a codebase building a closely related suite of products.
we planned projects and iterations on index cards in the old-fashioned xp way although our heads of development recorded estimates and summaries that were published for people who wanted a quick report of the current state
summary
we tried to minimise the amount of documentation - by focusing on what s needed and by whom rather than writing big weighty tomes for general use
we preferred automated technical documentation because of the rate of change of our code and the cost of documentation work - which is taken out of normal dev time
we preferred manual index card-based planning because it encourages more collaborative team behaviour and because it s simpler and faster - even though the heads of dev had to write up regular summaries
if you focus on simplicity and concreteness it s amazing how little electronic documentation you really need - especially management documentation
i think the problem lies with using single line comments
single-line comments enclosed in seem to work fine
here s an equivalent example with something other than a comment
or with comments using

how can i get lazy exception if the fetch type is eager
the ideas to keep in mind when working with a dvcs are
distribution even if you have one central github the developper are not limited to publish push only to that github repo
they can fork the repo and publish in their own version while fetching from the official central github repo -- called upstream
the advantage is they can rewrite history reset rebase --onto rebase -i ... as many times as they want in the end they will make a pull request allowing an integrator to manage their changes
one of publication in your own local repo you can setup as many branches as you want not one for every file modification of course but one for any new task or set of tasks you need to develop
but you can also set public branches that will be pushed published to your remote repo
see this question on git workflow and also jc hamano s articles on remote branches
o fun with remote branches 1
o fun with remote branches 2
the phrase when people were confident with code they would commit and then merge it into the staging should not apply with a dvcs commit early commit often but push publish only when you want
you could use strpos

when dealing with individuals that have an argument the correct way to evaluate them is through lambdify because evaluate creates an individual that is wrapped around a function without an argument
sadly you cannot convert individuals into python code
the individual is represented in the form of mul x mul add 1 x for example which is after that mapped to the primitive functions set in the toolbox and this is done because it s faster then creating python code or an ast and executing it
for future deap related problem i would recommend doing what cmdntrf suggested which is join the deap google group where you can ask your specific questions

someone correct me if i am wrong but i would not recommend using serialization for saving data
since any change to the class will render any previously saved versions of the data unusable
you should consider using a independent format for structuring the data for example json or xml or a custom one
using json is very easy and maps very easily to and from java objects for example and can easily be saved as a string preference in the app
and you can also handle any changes to the data pojo that holds the saved state in case you want to add or remove stuff in the future
with the addition of a single meta tag into your document you can instruct the browser to automatically reload at a provided interval

honestly i don t know very much about what this but what they taught me at school was that u can use a interface as a shell around a business class
so the object that s talking to the interface has no knowledge about the actual object behind it
therefore u maybe dont want to make setters as they would make it possible to modify and see the contents of the actual object
instead i was told to use methods to modify the object
somebody can clarify what i am saying or am i mixing things up now
what i am talking about in code translates as

the textcat package does this
it can detect 74 languages more properly language encoding combinations more with other extensions
details and examples are in this freely available article
hornik k. mair p. rauch j. geiger w. buchta c. feinerer i
the textcat package for n-gram based text categorization in r
journal of statistical software 52 1-17
here s the abstract
identifying the language used will typically be the first step in most
natural language processing tasks
among the wide variety of language
identification methods discussed in the literature the ones employing
the cavnar and trenkle 1994 approach to text categorization based on
character n-gram frequencies have been particularly successful
this
paper presents the r extension package textcat for n-gram based text
categorization which implements both the cavnar and trenkle approach
as well as a reduced n-gram approach designed to remove redundancies
of the original approach
a multi-lingual corpus obtained from the
wikipedia pages available on a selection of topics is used to
illustrate the functionality of the package and the performance of the
provided language identification methods
and here s one of their examples
this simple fiddle displays a list using ng-repeat

what do i have to do to fix this
i m trying to make a program that can turn off the monitor with a key combination and turn it back on with another
the power button fell off so the monitor pretty much stays on now
i noticed sending a wm_syscommand with a wparam of sc_monitorpower would probably do the trick but in reality it wasn t
first i tried putting a few getasynckeystate s in my message pump but whenever i tried to run it my keystrokes were not picked up
i tried moving the getasynckeystate s before the message functions
i tried using a while true loop and including getmessage in it
the only thing that started to work was commenting out all message pump references in the loop
this would pick up the keystrokes but when pressing 1 0x31 the monitor would only go dark the power light would stay solid for a few seconds before turning on
using a value of 1 for lparam to go into low-power mode would do the same thing
pressing 2 while it was dark would not do anything
my reasoning for this is that since i disabled the message queue defwindowproc was never able to handle these messages and thus they would produce incorrect results
i thought about setting up a loop when 1 is pressed to keep turning the monitor off for a few seconds at a time until 2 is pressed but i figured i ve done enough bad things to the code already window with no message loop and having code this bad would kind of ruin the point when i ll most likely need this information later anyways
all that s in my window procedure is a wm_close with destroywindow wm_destroy which shows the hidden window and calls postquitmessage and defwindowproc
so basically my question comes down to how can i use getasynckeystate with my message pump

also i noticed wm_powerbroadcast can achieve this too
is one better to use
edit commented the code so you know a bit extra
edit registerhotkey fixed one problem but the monitor still only goes dark for a few seconds power light solid

ideally the code can work for both links and buttons and ideally i don t need to specify the width for each link or button
if possible the width would be the width of the text and some margin or the width of the button
is this possible for internet explorer 7-9 and the latest versions of firefox chrome and safari
i haven t read the article but for starters i would suggest to de-emphasize the terms method and interface in c++
those terms are popular in strict oo languages like java but c++ is a broader multi-paradigm language
with that said adding methods to interfaces is really just adding more virtual member functions to a base class
changing the base class changes the definition of all derived classes and thus all code that requires the complete type of any derived class or of the base class must be recompiled
c++ types are not a runtime feature
types only exist at compile time and the compiler must have full access to the type definitions
again in contrast to other languages
the interface-implementation relationship exists purely at compile-time and cannot be precompiled
so there s really no such thing as modifying the interface that would produce runtime-modularity
the interface concept is just a neat mnemonic that you can use when designing your application but it does not save you from recompiling
changing a class definition changes the internal representation of the class and you cannot in general make a correct c++ program unless all parts of the program see the same class definitions
you can check using yourwindow .exists property
for example
yes
that is because you bind the event to that particular class
you can use event delegation to resolve the issue using on
when your event binding happens there is no element with the class .empty and the binding has no effect
instead of using the document head as used in my example use a container that exists in dom all the time and holds this element
so with event delegation you are actually binding the event to a container document head for delegation on the elements that are present in dom now as well as for the future

i have the following predicament
i have several enum types
i have a generic class implementation
and finally a class that contains a dictionary
on this class s constructor i do something like this
the problem is i can t figure out if i can express the some enum base type so that the instructions in the constructor could work
any ideas
please let me know if you need any more info
edit
thanks to nvoigt s answer i ve finally reached the following solution
first for a bit of context the genericclass has two methods relevant to this thread
i ve made the genricclass implement an empty interface
now the class that references the generic class looks something like this
this is just a head-up for other people potentially stuck with this problem in order to have a complete answer
your first step is to decide whether you will be doing the drive access from a javascript client or from a web server php java etc
oauth is very different depending on which flow you will be using
your second step is to decide whether or not you want to use the abstraction libraries or program directly to the http api
there are pros and cons to both methods
personally i elected to use the low level http apis for the following reasons -
they are more stable
the libraries are prone to breaking changes which can frustrate beginners
often you will find example code which won t compile v
the current library versions
the less third party code i use the easier it is for me to maintain
i find some of the oauth abstractions somewhat bizarre especially in the error handling
if you get errors they can be difficult to resolve at the sdk level and you find yourself needing to trace and hence understand the underlying http api anyway
many of the libraries are labelled beta which excludes them from production use in my company
if you choose to go the http api route then there are really only three resources that you need
firstly you need to understand oauth
secondly you need to validate your understanding using the oauth playground
finally you can learn and watch the drive api at eg
make sure you treat oauth and drive as separate topics
understand oauth first then tackle drive
i m sure a lot of people have success using the libs so i won t write them off completely
they re just not for us for the reasons above
one more tip remember that oauth is about authorisation not authentication
so you still need to do your authentication and user session management
having said that oauth does spit out a user token as a by-product so there is some overlap
my point is really that you need to roll your own user session management
theoretically nothing stops a manufacturer from making an ldpi device capable of running ics or jb
however in practice most devices with ldpi and even mdpi to some extent do not have good enough processors in both cpu and gpu departments to be able to run the newer version of android
till date the lowest i ve seen an ics device go screenwise is a normal-mdpi display
however i do not know the details of every device in existence and there could be lower devices as well
you should design your app keeping in mind all device configs at most excluding only ldpi and small displays
here is some code which will do what you want to to i think - but i ve got to ask - why do you want to serialize to a string like that
if the class is simple enough to serialise to a string use an xml serializer which is much easier to deal with
if you want to serialize it out to disk binary write it out to a file and if it is complicated and you are serializing it to transmit - consider using something like protobuf-net
i think the crux of your problem is that you are trying to use ascii encoding - i m using base64 encoding

i m loading a grayscale png image and i want to access the underlying pixel data
however after i load get the pixel data via cgimagegetdataprovider the length of the data returned is longer than expected
mapwidth comes out to 1804 and
mapheight comes out to 1005
the product of which is 1813020
when i call
the response is 1833120
where are these extra 20100 bytes coming from
any help here is much appreciated
am i missing something about the underlying format of the image
upon further examination of the cfdataref i found that if i loop through the buffer
for each row bytes 0 to 1803 will be correct from my image and then the next 20 bytes are all zero
so this means that my returned image is actually coming back as a 1824 by 1005 image instead of 1804 by 1005
still no explanation as to why

is it possible to write a sql script for both mysql and postgresql
yes
next question please
..
okay in all seriousness it s totally doable but you have to be aware of the things that each does differently
for example if you need to use a bytea in pg but a blob in mysql you re going to have a really fun time getting the encoding escaping correct
then there s things like fulltext searching
pg has it built in mysql has it built in to only one table type myisam the sucky one and the syntax is totally different
and this doesn t even touch character sets and collations
if you limit yourself to simple crud operations you re probably good to go
heck if you ve done your job right you can also probably use the same exact code to talk to sqlite and mssql when switched to ansi mode
once you even get moderately complex your code is going to need to at least be aware of the underlying database to work around the small behavior and syntax differences
the important part is that the majority of your queries can be shared between underlying databases without any modification whatsoever if you construct them properly
check your dns setup and make sure you ve got an a or cname record for subdomain.mydomain.com
just having your webserver set up to handle a particular domain name doesn t mean the hostname domain actually exists - the dns system must be configured for it as well
looks like you are only interested in the the attributes then try this out instead of the first sql

i think you can get the _ngcontent-ylc-1 property in ngafterviewinit from nativeelement
and then apply this property to your appended html
you have to use unicode strings
note that in your case you will have to set the
header
this should run in o n time
if you are using ui-router - whenever you place a link that points to that page set the reload option to true
use closest
for each element in the set get the first element that matches the selector by testing the element itself and traversing up through its ancestors in the dom tree
just use super.method_name from your method
with your label string example you have nothing to worry about for 2 reasons
nsstrings are immutable so you can t change the value after assigning it to a label unless you assign an nsmutablestring instead and later change it but..
string properties are typically implemented as copy so when you assign a value the receiving object makes its own internal copy of the string meaning the original object has no relation to it
so properties that are of the copy type will not be affected if you make subsequent changes to the object
other property types will just be a pointer to the original object and so if that object is mutable then subsequent changes will alter the underlying property
you can use not exists operator to exclude any records that match in weekly based on email or first and last name

there is not currently a way to use the sendmail command and have it update the lastverbexecuted.

if what you have in mind is a shared queue then i think you are going to have to synchronize the writes to it the pushes and the pops
but i still think it s worth aiming at the shared queue design
in comparison to the io of logging and probably in comparison to the other work your app is doing the brief amount of blocking for the pushes and the pops will probably not be significant

i ve been using the following method to add a border to the top of a view
the above gets specified in its own xml file within the drawable folder then set as the background on the view where i want the border to appear
now the problem here is that this border is hard coded to a specific background color
whichever view i apply it on the background color will be changed to #5f5f5f
i want to be able to set any background color then apply a border
in other words i can have a red view a green view and a blue view
suppose i want to place the same border on top of each one
is there a way to do this without making 3 copies of the above xml file and changing the color in each one

wynik is first assigned an empty string
the reason why the line 77 prints empty string is becausebash creates a subshell to execute | while .
done block as it does for all pipelines
remember that any modification of the variable in the subshell has no impact in the parent shell
the subshell inherites variables
when wynik is assigned a value line 72 can print it because it is still located in the subshell
after done outside subshell back in the parent shell the line 77 prints wynik value unmodified empty string

without seeing more of your class it s impossible to say for certain
but as a rule of thumb i try to avoid having fields or properties that are disposable i assume that s how it is since if it were a local variable you could use using
it s too hard to manage them unless your class is also idisposable and you clean it up in your dispose method
you could refactor these lines into their own method e.g
disposedb

good question i m not sure
my guess is that whichever one is declared first wins
so if your comes first the auto-detected component will get the request
if your comes first then that wins

one is getting every thing file while other is getting 403 error
i am unable to know what exactly the reason is
i used phpinfo on both servers
one difference i observe is that one use apache2 while other use some other http server named litespeed v6.6
but i don t know how if it affect this file_get_contents method
for more detail you can see their phpinfo page link below
where file_get_contents getting 403 the phpinfo is
while where it is working file here is the phpinfo
i will be thankful if someone can tell that what is effecting file_get_contents
please let me know if any idea

so as suggested in comment use bike instead of isbike
the reason for that is that hibernate reaches class properties through getters and setters
thus hibernate knows that to access property e.g
prop it must use accessor methods like getprop isprop and setprop ... so the programmer can simply use names of the properties and doesn t have to think about accessor methods
when you put isbike in your code hibernate was searching for method getisbike to access it which it obviously couldn t find
i currently working on a application that use entity framework 4.1 code first and sql server ce 4.0
one of the new things i really like from sql server ce 4.0 are the computed values
but i have some performance problem while importing old data into my new data store system around 50000 entries
this is my second implementation for this
the first version used entity framework 4.0 and sql server ce 3.5
but there is a huge performance difference between these implementations
the code first implementation takes around one hour to import the entries the other implementation only some minutes
the most time is spend in the savechanges method
i tracked the problem down to the attribute
if i use and implement my own generation of keys as a simple workaround the performance is back on the level of the first implementation
is this a known problem
is there any way to solve this performance problem
or is generating my own keys the way to go

edit to help the anonymous downvoter understand why this answer is actually obvious
the op gets this error message
you don t seem to accept cookies
cookies are required in order to log in.
so the server is expecting to see some cookies from the client
since the op is only doing one post request it s cookiemanager contains no cookies so it s not sending any cookies
none the less the server expects to see some cookies
where would those cookies come from in a normal browser-based session
well filling in the login-form is very very hard without actually navigating to the form first the get request

the main requirement here is in my mvc application i need to show pending - if the request is processing and completed - if the request is processed successfully.
so my tasks are usually to download big files from the server
so i decided to create empty files when starting the task and fill out the files when completion
and in my mvc application i check
size 0kb then processing
size 0 kb then downloaded
but when it comes to excel file the default size of the file is varying depends on the version of ms excel
so i need a proper way of handling the above scenario
any help to this will be appreciated much

i think you ll need to calculate each element separately so how about

sql fiddle demo
you basically want a nested for loop for each column of your matrix
but since the number of columns is dynamic you can t really do that in line
what you can do is use a recursive function with a for loop in it that iterates over the rows and selects the column based on a parameter which is incremented on each recursive call
something like this
demo
you re basically describing an event aggregator or dispatcher yes
i ve got a couple of articles on building and using them with backbone
and there are plenty more articles around the web for doing the same with backbone and other pub sub libraries
it s quite simple to do in backbone
and now you have a vent object that can be used as an event aggregator throughout all of your application s views and other objects
you can also implement this using pattern matching with function using guards
pattern matches may seem longer ternary operator but they are much easier to read when logic gets more complex
there is also something wrong with the solutions that i provided in the link of my original question and in the other solution i got
consider this
#include
the program will compile and write 10 and 12 in the console
wich defeats the purpose of the const qualifier
what is const here is the reference not the value
so i have come to the conclusion that it is not possible the have a static const class variable at execution time
you are calling session_start that will start the session
what you need to do is create the login script and then start the session
i would perhaps set a _session variable at this point like _session logged_in true
then in the navigation header check for
that would perhaps be a better way to handle this
you should not edit core files this will only bring troubles bugs headaches

that fix your issue
it is a common error in ftpclass of net
to understand what
means it is easiest to perceive a as an array of array of doubles instead of a matrix
therefore if you index a it will return an array of doubles
furthermore if you index a at some index it will return a double
hope this helps

i would like to encrypt a textual configuration file stored on disk
trying to use des encryption i ve had fatal error on client machines i later found out the algorithm could not handle accented characters

i suspect that was because i was using old packages sun.misc.base64decoder - but i m not sure that is the reason
however i m looking for a simpler solution - i need a really simple encryption i know some people would not agree on that - not rsa of 128 bit keys or so just obscuring the text from curious eyes
it is really weird that i could not find a simple trivial solution on the web
how can i implement a simple encryption scheme

i m having type issues when attempting to inflate a contextmenu while making use of the actionbarsherlock library which as you know ultimately mimics implements the android support library
there is a sherlockfragmentactivity which sets the layout content and within that content exists two fragments
one of those fragments is a sherlocklistfragment
within the oncreate of the sherlocklistfragment i make a call to register for the contextmenu
registerforcontextmenu getlistview
the problem stems when attempting to inflate the menu
i am unable to call inflate due to the type specified within the method parameters which it expects as com.actionbarsherlock.view.menu however the passed in type is android.view.contextmenu
i seem to be missing something as inflating a menu within the action bar was trivial however the contextmenu seems to be posing issues when making use of the support framework
how do i register appropriately to make use of the support framework as needed and subsequently inflate the contextmenu

i a trying to come with a regex to create a standard uk mobile number
from what i have seen in the data set the numbers come in the following different formats
what i am looking to do is have all of them start with 07 followed by 9 numbers e.g
so the first thing i need to do is remove all spaces
next i need to somehow match
this is where i think i become a bit stuck
at the moment i have this
it kind of works sometimes but i do not think it is very good
it does not start the string with 07 and it does not check the length after this
it also does not replace null with an empty string
how could i improve this mixture of regex and replace to format different numbers into the standard format i am after
thanks
this is basically going to tough to do when you dont have a specific way to select the two rows

first your pattern doesn t actually match your data in the first place
that s because your data has a space between the digits and the colon
you need to fix that
while we re at it i have no idea why you re putting a group around the preceding whitespace so let s not do that
so we get
now your only capturing group is the d+
so that will be group 1
which you can include in the substitution as 1
so
that still isn t valid json but it s what you wanted right
if you read the docs re.sub explains that backreferences such as 6 are replaced with the substring matched by group 6 in the pattern. for full details on back references for both groups and groups look them up in the regular expression syntax
you should also read the regular expression howto which explains all of this in a more novice-friendly way
notice that i made the substitution a raw string just like the pattern so i didn t have to escape the 1 and i also used single instead of double quotes so i didn t have to escape the characters
in view you can do
you can create a large select list and insert in batch
you may need to loop through in batches of a thousand
6000 probably won t work because you can only pass 2100 parameters in a query
alternatively as dan suggests you could modify the loop to eliminate the if statement

since you re going to be doing many replacements expensive cpu-wise and you re wanting to simply shorten your coding time why not also save cpu by wrapping str_replace

you should always use str_replace instead of preg_replace
newer versions of android 2.2 include the v8 javascript engine while older versions only had jsc
however according to
my question is this is there any way that i can determine which javascript engine is in use from within a webpage an embedded webview or an application
if the answer is no does anybody know which js engine is used by the android emulator
the reason i m asking this is because of this issue
basically it may be that the javascript-to-java bridge in jsc is broken on android 2.3.x and this impacts the application i m trying to write
i m seeing a segfault from somewhere deep in the jni on my emulator but not on the handful of physical devices i ve tested
i m trying to determine if this is an emulator-only thing a jsc-only thing or something different altogether
you have a forever loop with while true then there is an exception with message containing timed so s1 is set to zero and the loop is resumed
elapsed is 4399 you try to sleep for 1 millisecond which might be actually zero
so of course it is using all available cpu power possible since these conditions just keep on happening and there are no sleeps anywhere
as was suggested tasks might be a better way to handle this and it s quite bad practice to have an eternal thread with no way of exiting or handling all error situations
also i wouldn t use e.message as a way to determine what happened
what if the code is run on a machine that speaks french for example

does anyone know what the difference between mmap 2 and mmap 3 is
man section 3 is described as this chapter describes all library functions excluding the library functions described in chapter 2 which implement system calls. doesn t mmap 3 perform a system call
reading the two man pages i see that mmap 2 seems to accept a much wider variety of flags than mmap 3 does and claims to be able to map device i o spaces
mmap 3 claims to be able to map shared memory objects and typed memory objects in addtion to files but doesn t mention device i o
since the two functions have the same name i m not even sure how i can choose one rather than the other
there is nothing defined in the c library to query the total amount of physical memory used by a malloc call
the amount of memory allocated is controlled by whatever memory manager is hooked up behind the scenes that malloc calls into
that memory manager can allocate as much extra memory as it deemes necessary for its internal tracking purposes on top of whatever extra memory the os itself requires
when you call free it accesses the memory manager which knows how to access that extra memory so it all gets released properly but there is no way for you to know how much memory that involves
if you need that much fine detail then you need to write your own memory manager

essentially there are two ways to play around self reference for patches
use mock.any to ignore the first argument
patch object by patch.object instead of patching the static method reference
anyway 2 cannot be used in all cases sometimes you cannot have the object instance in test method context
moreover that way often make test less clear and more complicated
i always prefer to use 1 in my tests
the dialog framework is a simple framework for prompting users to obtain some data settings then performing some action or canceling

determine whether or not the form was submitted or if they are accessing page for first time
if nothing was submitted then call your form display function or your view

if data does not validate run the form display function view with the submitted data so they don t have to re-enter it along with an error
for lack of a better example let s say i have a container type defined that takes a single type parameter
assume this container wraps a list of the same type
i would like to define a method on my new container such that whenever an operation is performed it delegates the call to the embedded list but it returns my container type as a result possibly of a different type parameter
to accomplish this i will use the implicit builder pattern from scala collections
here s the basic structure
so this works as i would expect returning a foo string when my pf transforms from int to string
while the previous example was based on having a canbuildfrom that takes a from type of foo _ an element type of a and converts to a to type of foo a
what i would like to do is take a from type of list _ an element type of a and convert to a to type of foo a
something along these lines
here i have passed my implicit canbuildfrom parameter off to the list class directly so that it can build my foo class to store the results in
however when i run the same test instead of getting a foo string i get a list string
in other words it is not using my implicit it is using a generic version
so my question is why
i would have thought that if my current type is foo and i m converting to a foo and there is an implicit fn in scope matching the input parameter types list in this case then that would be the best match
am i doing something wrong or is this for security reasons that the from collection has the most precedence in choosing what collection it is converted to
is there something i can do to bump up my implicit s priority
fastest way would be by joining the table to itself joins are usually faster than subqueries

this is happening because you have data with zeros in it
if you want to prune them out in some way then either you can do it on the reads or you can sort the data
something like this should suffice
you can also do it like this
i want to redirect the links which are bad getting 404 errors
let s say i have the following url
if the above url is bad i want it to redirect it with .html suffix
so basically i want to make sure url is bad and it doesn t end with .html then only apply the rule which is same url with .html suffix
update it s not just foobar.html there are thousands of pages dynamic so simple use of foobar.html to redirect will not work
examples of what i am looking for
below url will go to standard 404 page
below url will go to it s .html page
below url will not redirect because of slash at end
below url is working and should not get redirected anywhere
this is not a file but a dynamic page

the sensors are analog there must be an analog to digital converter to read each of the opto transistor ir receiver
leda and ledb are not on at the same time
the opto transistor are running in a linear range not in saturation when no object is present
one object
4
when an one object is placed on the surface
there will be less light accessing some of the opto transistors
this will be reflected by a reading that is lower then the read when no object is present
the reading of the photo transistor array it is an array reflecting the read from each opto transistor will provide information about
4.1
how many opto transistors are completely shaded off
4.2
what opto transistor are effected
please note a reading from one led is not sufficient to know the object position
to get object location we need two reading one from leda and one from ledb
now we can calculate the object position and size since we know the geometry of the screen
two objects
now each array may have holes there will be two groups in the shaded area
these holes will indicate that there is an additional object
if the objects are closed to each other the holes may not be seen
however there are many leds
so there will be multiple arrays one for each led and based on the presented geometry these holes may be seen by some of the leds
for more information please see us patent# us7932899

you changed your comment to incorporate more of your question so i will expand my answer a bit
you have two sets of coordinates
world coordinates like scaled longitude and latitude on a world map or femtometers on a electromagnet microscope these are mostly your x and y
display coordinates these are the representation of your displaying device like a nexus 7 or a nexus 10 tablet with its physical dimensions pixels or pels or dots per inch
you need a metric that transforms your world coordinates into display coordinates
to make things more complicated you need a window the part of the world you want to show the user to clip the things you do cannot show like africa when you want to show europe
and you may want to zoom your world coordinates to match your display coordinates how much of europe you want to display
these metrics and clippings are simple algebraic transformations
zoom the world-coordinate to display-coordinate display-x world-x factor femtometer or kilometer to pixel
translate the world-center to display-center display-x + adjustment
and so on

i am seeing an issue java 6 on sles11 where a udp packet is being sent back to the client machine and tcpdump on the client machine shows it being received but the packet isn t being seen by java
the test works like this
the client side generates some random data sticks it in a udp packet sends it to the server on a particular port and waits for it to be echoed back with a so_timeout of 180000 ms
when it receives it back it prints out that it has received it and how long since it s been sent
the server side listens for a udp packet on a that port
when it receives it it delays a bit then sends it right back unchanged
the delay starts at some initial value 3000 ms then doubles each time it receives a packet until it reaches a maximum 90000 ms after which the delay just stays at the maximum
it works fine until the delay hits 48000 ms
the tcpdump running on the client shows the packet being sent and shows the reply packet arriving 48000 ms later
however the java program never sees that reply packet and after 180000 ms claims the receive timed out
even though the client machine got the packet after only 48000 ms as tcpdump shows
what could be happening
below is the output of the programs and tcpdump and after that is the source of the client and server programs
on the client machine the test program output is

there are two ways to save preferences in portlet development in liferay
through liferay specific way which uses liferay-portlet.xml entry

in spring mvc portlet framework you can map portlet requests by portlet mode
for example create controller class as below which will map to edit mode requests

i want to use caching in django and i am stuck up with how to go about it
i have data in some specific models which are write intensive
records will get added continuously to the model
each user has some specific data in the model similar to orders table
since my model is write intensive i am not sure how effective caching frameworks in django are going to be
i tried django view specific caching and i am try to develop a view where first it will pick up data from the cache
then i will have another call which will bring in data which was added to the model after the caching was done
what i want to do is add the updated data to the original cache data and store it again
it is like i don t want to expire my cache i just want to keep adding to my existing cache data
may be once in 3 hrs i can clear it
is what i am doing right
are there better ways than this
can i really add to items in existing cache

you can get the converted resultant value like this
this is at least one problem in your put method
if full is ever initialized as true how do you expect the loop to end
the other problem is this loop in the consumer
you re assuming the producer never lets the buffer get empty - if the consumer starts before the producer it will stop immediately
instead you want some way of telling the buffer that you ve stopped producing
the consumer should keep taking until the queue is empty and won t receive any more data
i want to remove the current view and add a new view which is switching from one view controller to the next in ios5 with automatic reference counting turned on
here s my current code

and i ve imported the new viewcontroller s header which probably wasn t necessary
under ios4 i would allocate the new nib and display it but i m not sure what to do to get rid of the old view and display the new one
thanks
i ve got a visual control in wpf which takes advantage of dependency properties
these properties are backed by fields which are classes and sometimes there s a need to notify all bindings that value of property changed when actually the contained class was modified
simply said
mydepprop is of type myclass
the contents of myclass changes due to control s internal operations
i want to inform everyone that mydepprop changed such that they can reflect to changes in myclass
msdn says that propertychanged is attached to dependencyobject when the dependency property is used for the first time
and it works in visual studio 2010
however after installing visual studio 2012 it stopped working even though the dp was used eg
binding was attached to it propertychanged is null and i cannot inform anyone of changes
i still use visual studio 2010 compiler toolkit so it seems that it s a matter of broken framework which was updated along with vs 2012
do i use the propertychanged event correctly
or is it a bug in .net 4.0 framework updated by vs 2012
have anyone encountered similar problem
edit a piece of buggy code
for reference the ihandle interface
the scenario
datasource is bound to another property using the binding
someone calls handle method of the control using the ihandle interface
handle checks whether propertychanged is not null and it is so no information about changes in datasource are propagated

there is no problem in your queries because of comma
since you are inserting records to different tables you need to separate each query with a query-separator or query-delimiter
in the example fiddle i have separated each query with a semi-colon and the queries get inserted without issues

i have to say
my experience regarding workflow in both java and .net when it comes to the core libraries or api libraries was either under-featured or over complicated
saying that i found that in most cases having a table with statuses did the trick
let me explain
have a foreign key in the table which contains your application form referring to a status table
have the status table with an id primarykey column and statusname column
the statuses should include
id 1 captured - user fill in application form
id 2 pending assistant manager approval - assistant manager approval
etc for all of the statuses..
have a user table or make usage java - acl which has group assignments for
each of the users vs groups
like for instance the people person who has access to assistant manager approvals will be able to see the application forms which have a status of captured
you should get the picture by now
on the other had i do find the jbpm very useful but i also think it has its place in much bigger workflow environments
look at this steps
being in this moment in the last prompt is there any way to go directly to programacion sports src sports platformbundle entity since it is the last path i have visited
you might make your intentions a little more clear by avoiding the factory
while the end result is probably the same with this approach you can at least end up injecting directly instead of
create a class called polymorphicvalidator
this will allow you to repeat this pattern in a consistent manner as well as provide a fallback base validator if you so desire
this is essentially the recommended composite pattern described here in the simple injector documentation
you can then register your validator like this optionally providing a base class fallback and additional child class validators
this will create a singleton polymorphicvalidator which contains singleton child validators singletons are recommended by the fluentvalidation team
you can now inject as shown in your first notificationvalidator example
here s the way to get the value
inside the onok function
just substitute the delimiter character you want
use this link
you can find many date formats
hope this ll help some one

it s simply an interesting question to me surely the running app must know

android studio beta v0.8.14 with the android sdk for mac does not appear to include the sdk you need to install the sdk manually e.g

you need to use the buttons on the welcome dialog and not on the applications menu bar or preferences as i had initially thought
step by step
note that sdk manager is greyed out until you complete this at which point you cannot undo it for the purposes of taking screenshots...
navigate back and the sdk manager button on the configure panel should be enabled
clicking it should display something like this
firstly your example won t compile as you have a hanging at the end of the pattern string
secondly you misplaced the greedy 0+ quantifier in all groups following the first one - you can easily work around it by using instead of
the subtle difference between the above patterns lies essentially in what you are grouping
thirdly you re probably better of splitting your input by whitespace and iterating over the array elements

as your array is 0- indexed you can retrieve each item by its index e.g

i am a newbie to c programming
and i am confused with the chaotic behavior of pointers
specially when it comes to strings and arrays
i know that i can t write like
because clearly it will try to write to the 5th location of the memory.and that will crash the program.i have to initialize the number
but when it comes to strings i can write like
and it works too
so that means it implicitly initialize the name pointer.i also know that name name 0 but i have found that name name too
how can it be
because to me it looks two variables with the same name
can anybody tell me how strings are created in memory
all this time time i assumed it creates name 0 .....name n-1 and another variable a pointer called name inside that we put the location of name 0 .seem to be i was wrong.

you should try to make your application do not stop responding instead
one way of doing it is to launch those complex tasks in different threads and after a timeout kill em
your code looks good except
you need to copy the vertexes as well similar to your graph-copy
copying the graph and using the same vertexes generates not a real copy
you can append a hidden input to the form before submission
allow is an rspec method defined in
you can verify this by executing the following example
which should generate something like
if you use a different matcher name i would think you d be ok
my suggestion is to have single pattern used for your db helper
so you will have sessionfactory inside single dbhelper class and it will private sessionfactory variable inside the class
this is more similar to your static approach but using proper pattern
for memory usage better start with 250 mb min and max 1024 mb perm as 256mb
latter you can increase memory as your load increased
for example as below.
private sessionfactory sessionfactory
private static dbhelper instance null
private constructor
private dbhelper
initialize your session factory here

public static dbhelper getinstance
if instance null
instance new dbhelper

return instance

public static object insertintodb object object throws exception constraintviolationexception
do your coding to insert db


public class booking
so always it uses single insertdb method
dbhelper.getinstance .insertintodb booking

what is the best hgignore list for vc6 projects
it s kind of old and i can t google it
i found there was a list for vs2010 and vs2008 but the project files are totally different
i am doing a tracking site like google adwords
i am doing only modifications
in that site i have seen they are creating tables for each month and merging that table into one this is done for the tables which stores information about clicks and search details and the merged tables having crores of records.and for querying they have used only the merged table which is having crores of records
is there any advantage of using tables like this
and the query is taking more than 10 minutes to execute
you don t actually need any implicit conversions here
the trick is to take advantage of custom extractor objects like so
you then use it like this
you could actually expand this to an arbitrary product by using the dynamic access methods on that class but you d lose some type safety in the process
i have the dynamic json object like
i want to add some text like new in each value
result
can anyone please tell how to achieve this one
the tack that i took was to mock out the data context
i use a factory to create the data context and inject it into the controller
if the factory is null which is what happens when the parameterless constructor is called it creates a default instance of the factory that connects to the database
in my unit tests i use a factory that creates a fake data context that works in memory
i based my mock data context on code from this blog though i ve extended it to handle objects added to the database via entity sets
if you don t want to go the mock route and i would recommend it though it will take some work up front
you can add an app.config file to your unit test project and put the connection strings for your data context in it
i m sure you ve ran into this before so i would like to know how did you deal with this issue

i have my wcf service hosted in windows service
the client application is a website project to which i add service reference
now windows service configuration file has the right settings for maxreceivedmessagesize
but when i add service reference to website project it updates the web.config with default values

the maximum message size quota for incoming messages 65536 has been exceeded
to increase the quota use the maxreceivedmessagesize property on the appropriate binding element

i m using tabs studio to group my tabs in visual studio
i m having difficulties finding the correct regular expression to group my tabs using the conventions i ve used
it works using two named backreferences
it groups tabs that have a matching and allows you to select the different
the problem is here are the files i d like to be grouped
userprofilecontroller.cs
userprofileviewmodel.cs
userprofile.cshtml
user-profile.js
user-profile.less
so far i ve got an expression that matches the first 3 and last 2 into two separate groups
the problem is manipulating the output of the backreference
the comparison is case-insensitive anyway so all i really need to do is remove the - from the backreference output
is this possible
note i ve put this on stackoverflow as at its heart it s a regex question though its purpose for me is very specific
i m not too confident about this so please let me know if you think this belongs somewhere else

in appkit we have representedobject available through nsviewcontroller this representedobject is generally set to modelcontroller or the model which the nsviewcontroller displays this works great with bindings as you just set the new representedobject and model details are updated in the view but in case of iphone uikit with no cocoa bindings available there is no such representedobject in uiviewcontroller so here are few things i am interested in knowing -
what is the best recommended way of binding the model to the uiviewcontroller
preferably dont want to maintain lot of iboutlets and calls setters to updated the changed model data for display in view
how when should the related model of the uiviewcontroller be released
when is the called in the typical iphone application
am looking for architecting some classes so that the uiviewcontroller coordinates between the view and the model but at the same time deallocs the model when ever not necessary

following is the python code which should accept the passed value
if i run the below code directly from console then it returns the result in json format but running it indirectly has not succeeded

also i should be able to see the returned data in json format in my web browser

the first createbitmap is run with widthheight on a bitmap that got rotated instead of heightwidth
this should be as
when saving file you don t get the correct path you use a hardcoded path and lint warns about it
jniconverttogray doesn t really need to go over arrays and can just use a pointer as it just runs on a single pixel
you store the bitmap into jni twice instead of once just do store rotate grayscale restorefree
you don t use the new bitmap after you have finished working on it so if i call rotation multiple times it doesn t seem to do anything
you already have bitmapwip rotated and grayscaled
why do you need to make a new bitmap that has its content in it do a grayscale on it and then save it
functions should be named with lowercase letter in the beginning of their names
and finally the most important thing you use alpha_8 for the image that you show and need to save to file
this configuration has no color
it s a mask
in order to see the problem you should set a background color to the imageview
before choosing the rotation you see nothing red
after choosing it everything you think is white has actually become red
that s because it s transparent..
if in any phase of your development you ve succeeded saving the image to a file and thought it s a black image yet the size is not 0 try to edit it and put a background behind it
maybe you got lucky and just got transparent pixels..
adding the fact that you save the file to a jpg format which doesn t support transparency might also contribute to unexpected behaviors
in order to solve this you should use the same technique i ve used - use a single bitmap all the time
no need to create so many
only one should exist on the java world and it should support having colors

i m trying to avoid having to chain a bunch of backgroundworkers together

i also tried the following which did the same thing
is it possible to do what i want and if so what am i doing wrong
i use this approach
this way i find improves the readability of the line - as i read quickly through a source file i can see it s a null check
with regards to why you can t call .equals on an object which may be null
if the object reference you have namely drawable is in fact null it doesn t point to an object on the heap
this means there s no object on the heap on which the call to equals can succeed

i am currently attempting to implement a small telnet server which spawns a pty on a connection from a client and transmits the output of a small ncurses application to the client

my use case does not require users of the application to log into user accounts so i would prefer not to delegate proper transmission of the screen to system tools such as telnetd
given a tcp connection what are the requirements for transmitting a textual ncurses interface over telnet or ssh
what types of buffering or encoding are necessary for ensuring that screen refreshes on the client side appropriately render the application
this is obviously handled during a typical ssh session however how is it done

if i m in foo.c calling bar from one of the includes i d like to be able to go directly to the bar that is referenced by foo not spend time making sure i m going to the correct definition for instance if multiple files in my source tree have bar functions that foo doesn t reference

i need to run ssh-keygen commmand in my shell script
it will ask for following inputs
enter the target file name
enter the pass phrase
enter the pass phrase again
how can we pass these three inputs to the command
i tried with
and
echo -ne n | echo -ne n |ssh-keygen but still no positive result
note am avoiding the input file name request in the above two command just to make the things simple
i m having issues with facebook scraping my pages
the facebook debugger is giving me a 504 timeout
i starting to think it s because of ipv6 support on my ec2 instance
i m in the process of setting up a elb to test this out
anybody have an issue with this
it used to work just fine but you know how the cloud can change on you
is the elb the only support for ipv6
what about api gateway
lastly the practice has been to terminate ssl tls at the elb and rely on private internal networks in aws to protect your data from the elb to the ec2 instance
can i rely on aws to get my traffic to my ec2 instance and back without a sniffer picking off my sensitive data
thanks in advance

i was reading an article about reducing your win32 pe size
i am currently working on a project which one of its characteristics is a very small pe size
i asked myself - is stl that is - the standard templates library usable dynamically instead of statically
i guess that because it uses templates which are compile-time generated it can be a bit of a problem
so - is it possible
i would use a database for the questions something like
then i would do a where like query
you can move your controller logic to a service and reference it as twig global variable and then include the template rendered by the controller
see
is it possible to tell a range to ignore any empty cells
for example i start my macro with
as there is a value in b12 b13 and b14 there shows no errors
but i would look to be able to expand the range to b22 for example however if there is nothing in a cell in the range i get error messages
its from a user input so they will never enter more than 10 values but could possibly enter less
below is the full code but its quite long so my apologies if not neccessary
the right syntax should be

i have written a class for my programming assignment
when i run the test class it shows all of the regiments their initial values and the first report
however the if statement at the bottom of the test class isn t working how i want it to
i want it to make more reports until there are no regiments left
here are the specifications for the assignment
i
problem statement
the following story is told about the russian army at the time of the russo-japanese war
it seems that 20 regiments were in a continuous process of formation
the first had 1000 men the second had 950 the third 900 and so on down to the twentieth regiment which garrisoned only 50
during each week 100 men were added to each regiment and at week s end the largest regiment was sent off to the front
apparently the commander of the 5th regiment was a wonderful chess player
to delay his eventual trip to the front the general of the army who happened to be his chess partner sent him only thirty new recruits each week instead of 100
write a java program that tells which regiment is sent to the front each week shows the status of the remaining regiments and determines exactly how long it takes for the chess-playing commander to go to the front
ii
specifications
create a class to represent a regiment
each regiment knows its regiment number name and strength number of men
create another class to represent an army an army is a collection of regiments
your army class will feature separate methods to do each of the following
add a regiment to the list
update the list i.e. add new men to each regiment
find the largest regiment
print a report
your test class will read the regiment number and name for each regiment from a data file until eof compute the number of initial recruits for the regiment create a regiment object and add it to the list
then for each week of the simulation it will then call the methods that update the list and print the report
output will be a series of reports --- one report for each of the 20 weeks
each weekly report should begin with an appropriate heading including the week number
the report should state which regiment is being shipped out that week and data on the remaining regiments i.e. those which have not yet gone to the front should be in column form neatly aligned with headings
for each remaining regiment print the regiment number name and the current strength of the regiment
here is the regiment and army class
this is my test class
here are the contents of the text file that was used as input
1
aardvarks
2
begonias
3
chrysanthemums

the if statement at the end of the test class only works for one update
i want it to continue to show reports up until the last regiment is left
any help would be greatly appreciated and thank you so much for your time

a set of sps is an interface that is likely to be modified more frequently than structural changes
and because sps contain business logic changes should be stored in version control to track the modifications and adjustments to the logic
storing these in version control is a symptom of organizational maturity at a coding level and is a best practice
why do you think clone is a shallow copy
see here
as it says - what clone does is implementation dependent
also a shallow copy doesn t simply create a new reference to the same object - generally it means that a new instance is created with the same internal members as the object copied-from
but if you change a member variable of the new obj to point to something new you are not changing member vars of original obj
hi i was doing this exercise and wanted to get the size of array after i pass the pointer to the array to the function
but the sizeof operator doesn t work on pointer but works on the array name
why is it so
is this any way i could get the size of the array on the findput function

i just digged into the loader api and using cursorloader and asynctaskloader to populate and manage listviews
my data comes from an json api endpoint so i am using retrofit to perform network tasks currently using asynctask
does it make sense to reimplement this in asynctaskloader and using a simplecursoradapter instead
because right now it does not to make sense i have no cursor since my data is not backed by contentprovider as it would be the case for instance when accessing a database or similar
should i just stick to asynctask and arrayadapter or is there a way to use the new api

i m trying to create a custom jdialog
i would like to have the components stacked on top of eachother with their preferred height but the width should fill the container
similar to linearlayout in android
i want that the components keeps their preferred height when the window is resized
from using layout managers
scenario you need to display a few components in a compact row at their natural size
consider using a jpanel to group the components and using either the jpanel s default flowlayout manager or the boxlayout manager
springlayout is also good for this
e.g
i would like to have a jtextfield above a jtabbedpane
i have tried with all the suggested layout managers flowlayout boxlayout springlayout but they don t preserve the natural size of my components when the jdialog window get increased height
is there any layout manager in java swing that i can use for my situation
here is a small example that shows my problem with the swing layouts
say i have some object array
can i use ruby s include
method to do something like this
i ve spent hours trying to add a new tab to the menu on the backend of magento system configuration followed multiple tutorials but it still doesn t show up
the code i ve written
app code local packagename helloworld etc system.xml
and
app code local packagename helloworld etc config.xml
and the obligatory helper
app code local packagename helloworld helper data.php
the cache is turned off
so as far as i ve understood it this should add a new tab to the menu under system- configuration on magento backend
but it does not
so maybe someone has an answer to this it would be highly appreciated
in general the command line tools tf.exe tfpt.exe automatically determine the server based upon the workspace that the current directory is mapped to
if you are running the command in a directory that is not mapped in any workspace then you will need to explictly specify the server
some commands require a workspace e.g
tf edit and you will not be able to run them without a local folder workspace mapping
to explicitly specify a server
for the visual studio 2008 tools you
can use
server
for the visual studio 2010 tools you
use

i want to control the backlight value of a lcd monitor in a embedded linux device
doing researches throughout the internet i found a couple of references saying that the file called backlight inside the backlight s driver folder in sys classes holds the key it s just a matter of changing the value inside such as using the echo command in terminal that one would get this results
references saying that includes this link this and this one
in my specific case the file is located inside sys devices platform pwm-backlight backlight pwm-backlight and there all the relevant mentioned files are located actual_brightness brightness max_brightness
using the echo command i did managed to control de backlight but the problem is that this command is unstable
sometimes i change the value inside the file and the backlight reacts accordingly
other times nothing happens
i couldn t find any particularity that would justify why sometimes it works and others don t and that s why i m here
what could be happening that makes this works sometimes and others not
is there something lacking in programming or would it be a driver or even hardware problem
and what should i do to correct this instability
it s worth mentioning that i did compile the linux kernel in accordance to what seems needed see this link
given the instructions in this page the driver being used is called generic pwm based backlight driver
i m using a texas instruments omap l138 processor
by the way it s worth mentioning that a counter solution that doesn t involve changing that file is accepted such as for example what is shown in this link
not possible according to this
query middleware differs from document middleware in a subtle but
important way in document middleware this refers to the document
being updated
in query middleware mongoose doesn t necessarily have
a reference to the document being updated so this refers to the query
object rather than the document being updated
update is query middleware and this refers to a query object which has no ismodified method

you should do it inside of your controller you can use
right after this line
you can also narrow it down to specific controller actions so let s say you want to restrict access to specifically the create and destroy actions you can do
which allows them to still freely access your other actions
hope that helps
the control you want to use change modifier property so you can acces it from outside

following are the steps to allow user to sign up via facebook
table structure that i have used to done this task is as below
first create view file with following code inside
i placed it in views users signup.ctp
apply some css to make it look more beautiful
now inside same view file add following code at the bottom of the page
just replace facebook_api accordingly
now inside users_controller file paste below code
what controller code do is check if facebook user with posted id is already register then allow him to login to site and set cakephp auth.user session and if not then add user and his her picture with all other data into mysql database
now you have user entry inside your database so you can ask use to change his password once he she change password then they can login to your application without login in to facebook account
above code is fully tested more than once and its working
done
as far as i can tell you followed this guide
you don t need special directories if you want to do that because the key is appended as a get argument
but if you want it like that downloads somekey
you can use apache mod_rewrite to rewrite all urls that begin with download to download.php have a look at the google results for mod_rewrite for guides to do that
if it were pulling from a database the data would have a primary key and therefore just use getelementbyid and apply the appropriate styling

i was just going through some codes of c++
where in i came across the concept of reinterpret_cast operator
edit 1
i know that accessing private members of a class is not recommended
but in some situations we ought to go ahead and access them
i have just put forth this question to get my concepts clear
in the example that i referred the private member of the class is accessed by simply creating a structure with the same variables and then later on modified by implementing
reinterpret_cast operator
i have understood the usage of reinterpret_cast operator as in i know what it does but i fail to understand how a structure could be used to modify the values of a private class member
following is the source code which i referred
class
structure used to access and modify private class members
thank you.please correct me if i m wrong i couldn t put forth my question in an appropriate manner
i don t know of a direct translation for that into freemarker but you could write a custom directive to handle that easily
freemarker has built ins for url escaping as well
funcone alex is not setting a parameter it is calling the function funcone
when executes it returns the parameter arg to the caller
echo funcone alex will echo alex because that is the value returned
after return funcone does not know about alex any more
when you call functwo it executes but is not defined it has no value assigned
almost all values in your column are within the range of the query so not only would the index be next to useless it would add little value but it would actually be much more expensive to use the index than do a simple table scan

the easiest way to see if some action is causing too many events to be raised and see a list of events and methods that were triggered is to use a performance profiler like jetbrains dottrace performance
start the profiler click the start profiling button perform the action click get snapshot and then you will be able to find exactly what events are being raised and exactly how many times each of them was raised
ok now this is the part where it gets embarrassing..
turns out that this script contains the very same code multiple times and executes it multiple times..
so the code posted above actually works and doesn t return any error like it should
the error-message is caused by the next occurence of the code that hasn t been patched yet

dr i probably should trash that script and rewrite it from scratch

dismiss is something you have to explicitly call in your code usually to respond to a click event on a button in your dialog
if you prefer you can call dismissdialog in the activity which will in turn call dismiss on the dialog
the cancel method only executes when it is explicitly called in your code or when the user presses the back button when your cancelable dialog is open as lee noted
if you are using a datepicker then all of this is still the case
as lee said datepickerdialog.ondatesetlistener just detects when the user has chosen a date from the datepicker

you have to both filter and use a key argument to max
the filter can also be expressed as a generator expression
demo
note that because you filter it s easy to end up with an empty list to pick the max from so you may need to catch valueerrors unless you need that exception to propagate up the call stack

how do i ensure only the right command is obey
q2
the app would not bring me back to the previous game menu
did i miss out something here
q3
and how do i need to code to get back to the main menu

it terminates itself instead
you cannot
within a scope a specific name refers either to a local variable or to a non-local e.g
global or from an outer function variable
not both
the global rawr line makes rawr a global for the entire scope that s why you get a warning it doesn t do what you think it does just like assignment to a variable makes it local for the entire scope
edit thanks to veredesmarald we now know it is in fact a syntax error in python 2
this half of my answer only applies to python 3 apparently
you should just use a differently-named local variable and in the branch where you want to promote it to a global set the global and the local variable
or just don t use globals at all.

i ran into this problem i have 27 uiview s laying on top of each other with exactly the same frame visually they are laying next to each other visual respresentation
so the frame for all of them is the big yellow square
they get masked using a cashapelayer the colored triangles
i add a uipangesture to all of them not sure this is the best way to do it and i want to determine on which one the user panned
of course obviously only the top one is accessible and always is the view in the uipangesture
how do i determine on which one of the uiview s the finger was panning
a for loop seems expensive too
or am i approaching this wrong
this is the code for creating all of them and handling the pan gesture
gist to code
sender to tag is always 27 though of course.
no clue how to solve this one guys
anyone a clue
the user experience should be something like this
user selects item from a spinner
depending on which item was selected a submenu dialog multiple-choice opens where user selects one submenu item
depending on the selected spinner item and the selected submenu item something is displayed
i tried to implement 2 as an alertdialog which kind of worked but ran into the problem that 3 would execute before the user had selected an item from the submenu 2
as far as i understand it is not possible to have 3 wait for the closing of the dialog correct

is there some way to implement a ui like this
i could probably implement 2 as a second spinner but would rather not occupy more screen space so am looking for a solution with something that disappears after selection

i have a table with a column of checkboxes as it appears here
the problem i have is that switching the checked property of any input on any row the change is always applied on the element in the first row
so from my understanding the css rules
are always applied to row-1
a possible solution could be adding a rule for each row
however i would rather not use this option as it is not the best for maintainability and the number of rows is not known until run-time
how can i fix this
what data-model variables the template needs only turns out as the template executes
that s because of #if-s -s etc
also it s not always obvious that if you have a then x refers to a data-model variable or there will be an x in another scope like a global variable at that point
you could still do a pretty good guess if you walk the tree of the template though
you can start that with tempalte.getroottreenode
as you will see it s a deprecated api because backward compatibility is not promised but it s actually unlikely to have changes in 2.3.x that would break existing code as far as the code tries to walk the tree with as few assumptions as possible
i suppose that htmlspecialchars function is called after posting the form to php
simplest solution then will be to match against regular expression first and then do htmlspecialchars
also if you have string encoded with htmlspecialchars after decoding with htmlspecialchars_decode php internal representation will be so you break nothing
there is big difference how you write strings by hand to php file and how php internally handle them
you really don t need to be bothered by this

however now the build will fail on the unbound dependency because one of the licenses is illegal
is it possible to configure the license plugin in such a way that it will allow a dependency if it contains at least one allowed license despite any illegal ones

this is my maven license plugin configuration
and this is the generated line in my third-party.txt
thanks to kanchirk i ve figured it out
i m still new to angular but with your suggested post i got it
what i had read is that i had to pass in sce as a dependency injection but i thought passing it as a variable in the function was doing that
once i figured that out how wrong i was it worked like a charm
along with
thanks to all for their help and suggestions
i really appreciate it
there are a few ways
here are two
set a non-100 width on .main-menu and then add margin 0 auto
remove the floats from .main-menu ul li add display inline-block to it and add text-align center to .main-menu
i have several json files zipped with .gz format in some hdfs directories in a tree like

in some code i m trying to learn from the maze string below is turned into an array code not shown for that and saved in the instance variable maze
the starting point of the maze is represented by the letter a in that maze which can be accessed at ---row 1 column 13
however the code i m looking at uses maze 1 13 1 to get the a which you can see returns the same result in my console
if i do maze 1 13 2 it returns the letter a with two blank spaces next to it and so on
13 3 returns a with three blank spaces
does the 2 in 13 2 mean return two values starting at 1 13
if so why
is this some feature of arrays or two dimensional arrays that i don t get
maze string
absolutely
in your problem you want to sort depending on one or more than one attribute
i am assuming here that an attribute has more value than another attribute so for example if you order by cost at first and you end up with three items with same cost you fall into sorting depending on another less-valued attribute profit for example
the algorithm
sort with an efficient sorting algorithm - say quicksort
extract duplicates if any then sort them using the other less-valued attribute
combine both arrays - this depends how do you want the final sort to be
print
this algorithm should be total of
objective from a list of strings set as variables take one at random and display it in a new tkinter window assuming there is already one in the program
also how would one implement a class to run in a program
it is different than the objective i am assuming.
technical information
using python version 2.6.8 for technical reasons pycharm ide community version
possible solutions use the randinit command to get a random integer and depending on what the integer is assign a string to a variable which will then be display via the tkinter label s textvariable command
conceptional code for a class
what i need either a correction to conceptional code different command i could use or different code using the objectives listed
please comment if i am missing any essential information and please respond thoroughly but quickly
please note that my programming back-round is very little in python and in general
some concepts might have to be explained
i m familiar with the in-app payments from google proper
but are there other solutions which can be implemented for apps distributed through the amazon marketplace
alternatively does the google iap system work if the app wasn t distributed through the google marketplace
try this simple apporoach without code
1.insert a column a and put auto row numbers 1 2 3...n
2.sort all columns by column b to group all blank spaces in first rows
3.copy all column c values to clumn b in one move
resort columns by column a
delete column a
in your commented code you need to access those elements using
yes it is possible use pack
i have a problem with the understanding of sending objects variable or else from my red5 java server application to a as3 script
the problem im facing is that i wrote down the following code in java
it invokes a method in my actionscript that calls say with his parameters called params
so far so good
my actionscript looks like
so it gets the array but i cant use it its tells me that cause the following error
typeerror error #1034 type coercion failed cannot convert object 123b4a7f1 to array
so can someone tell me how to convert this part right
i saw some articles about serializing but didnt get the problem
this code should create an array in main and then print it but every time i run it i just get an array of all 0s
you re on a shared hosting
your hosting provider might want to prevent abuse of cpu usage between each shared host
to prevent abuse they prevent you from running multi-thread tasks
when you load an image imagick which is an image processing tool tries to use multi-thread to be as fast as possible
adding this rule you tell imagick to run only on a single thread and this prevent the previous error

i have developed a few forms for analysing data on a access database
now i would like to know if it would be possible to host the forms on a link over the net having the database in a different system
basically i want the database to be in a different system the user should see the forms and use it but all processing must take place in the system where the database is
the user must then be able to see the results
is this possible
i m following this article on how to get the battery status on a windows mobile device
this works well when the pda is not being charged
the returns matches what is seen on the power screen of the pda
however when the pda is charging the returned is 100
i ve also compared all the class member values when charging and not charging and can t see anything i could use in place of batterylifepercent
i can use aclinestatus or batteryflag to detect if charging but it would be great to show the user something like charging
88 so they know when the charge has reached 100
has anyone come across this before
apologies if my prior searching was inadequate and the answer is here somewhere

i wanna know if php can remotely store when the user is logged in such as date and ipaddress maybe use cookies or a database i don t know and i m not sure
btw my question means that if last time i logged on was 4 5 2014 from 108.25.1.123
it would echo
last login 4 5 2014 from 108.25.1.123
ignore the database and cookies if im wrong
exactly the same problem and this fixed it
these are my dependencies
lets s say someone gave me a random hdf5 document
i would like to write a function that checks what are the groups keys used
take pandas hdfstore
for many methods which retrieve hdf5 data one requires to know the key e.g
pandas.hdfstore.get
what is the most efficient way to check the identity of keys if not a priori known
i would use a generator
edit i believe the ultimate answer to your question is pep-3104
in most languages that support nested
scopes code can refer to or rebind
assign to any name in the nearest
enclosing scope
currently python
code can refer to a name in any
enclosing scope but it can only
rebind names in two scopes the local
scope by simple assignment or the
module-global scope using a global
declaration
this limitation has been raised many
times on the python-dev mailing list
and elsewhere and has led to extended
discussion and many proposals for ways
to remove this limitation
this pep
summarizes the various alternatives
that have been suggested together
with advantages and disadvantages that
have been mentioned for each
before version 2.1 python s treatment
of scopes resembled that of standard
c within a file there were only two
levels of scope global and local
in
c this is a natural consequence of
the fact that function definitions
cannot be nested
but in python
though functions are usually defined
at the top level a function
definition can be executed anywhere
this gave python the syntactic
appearance of nested scoping without
the semantics and yielded
inconsistencies that were surprising
to some programmers -- for example a
recursive function that worked at the
top level would cease to work when
moved inside another function because
the recursive function s own name
would no longer be visible in its
body s scope
this violates the
intuition that a function should
behave consistently when placed in
different contexts
i would work with a simple replace

if you have created a singleton class and set the constructor to private what advantage does having the class marked abstract give

as gabriel mentioned soap message that is sent by php is slightly different
issue is that the xml created for the request from php introduces the id in the xml and then wherever it finds the same node it just passes the id as the reference
example below soap message is captured using fiddler -
to overcome this create two different items with the same structure
you may utilize clone
create new function preparevalueext as below and use it for lines
and change code for newrow as well
if you are talking about php you can do something like this
basically we separate each words using a space as separator then we take the relevant part of the resulting array the ten first words
you can easily the number of words taken in each part by modifying the variable or the start place with the variable
implementation in another language will be identical

typically in wpf we bind collections preferably collections that support change notification like observablecollection of data objects to ui controls
rather than adding new items to the ui controls we add the items to the collections in the code behind view model
as long as the collection support change notification the ui controls will be automatically updated
so to add a new row to your datagrid you need to add a new item to your collection
you should be able to access your data bound collection in your attachedproperty using

if you want to add just one question you can combine inheritance with specialization
the downside of this approach is that you have to reimplement certain operations destructors copy constructors etc. for each specialization
another option would be
though then there are potential issues with dependent name lookup
a third option and probably the one i would choose would be to use a non-member function
it uses the os language specified in settings language keyboard
for instance i have a phone in japan that i can use with both english and japanese.i can see the different descriptions
titles etc in google play when i switch the language
there is no general way to get the window handle of an application because there s no guarantee that any program has one window handle
a program may have many top-level handles i.e. microsoft word one for each document or it may have no windows at all
you might question what you really need the window handle for
there could be better ways of doing whatever it is you re trying to do that don t require any specific window handle
winexec which has been deprecated for nearly 15 years so you should seriously consider not using it anymore and shellexecute return absolutely no information about the programs they start if indeed they start any program at all
shellexecute might use dde to send a command to an already-running instance of the application. and if they start an application it might finish running before your program gets to run anymore
you can use createprocess or shellexecuteex instead
if they start a program they will give you a process handle representing the program they started
you can use that to help you get additional information about the program such as a list of its windows
don t bother with findwindow
the caption and window class aren t guaranteed to be unique
a program might use the same class name for many different windows and multiple instances of a program would use the same class name without much way to select the one you really want
enumwindows is a function you can use to get a list of candidate window handles
you give it a function pointer and it will call that function once for each top-level window on the desktop
you ll need a way of telling it which process you re interested in and a way for it to return a list of results
the function only accepts one parameter so the parameter will have to be a pointer to a structure that holds more information
twndlist is a type i made up to hold a list of hwnd values
if you have delphi 2009 or later you could use
for earlier versions you could use a tlist descendant or whatever else you choose
createprocess will tell you the new process id in the dwprocessid member of the tprocessinformation record it fills
shellexecuteex only returns a process handle so use getprocessid on that
the window-enumerating function needs a callback function matching this signature
you can use enumwindows to get a handle list like this
you ll implement the callback function like this
once you have the list you can inspect other attributes of the window to determine which ones are really the ones you want
you might determine it by window title or class name or perhaps by the other controls that are one that window
when you re finished using the process handle make sure you call closehandle on it so the os can clean up the process s bookkeeping information
we use apache mod_perl 2 and occasionally get a child
i would like to monitor for such children every second or so and when finding one send it a usr2 signal so it can dump its current perl stack to our error logs
note that we are using rlimit bsd resource but when a process exceeds its memory rlimit it dies immediately with no good way to log or take action see getting stack trace from perl out of memory error
so afaict rlimit will have to be complemented by an external monitoring program.
i see that monit is highly regarded but i can t figure out any way to monitor and send a signal to an individual
if i have to write a perl script that does this is there anything that will efficiently monitor the process table
proc processtable takes .02 secs of cpu to generate a single table so running that every second seems unnecessarily expensive
opening up a usr bin top -b -d 1 | and parsing the results is my current best idea
obviously would rather not badly reinvent a wheel if possible

i have done something similar where my feature vector is how many times each product description contains each dictionary word so for each entry you get a long vector which is mostly 0 s with a few 1 s or 2 s
you can then feed this into a clustering alg of your choice i used kmeans also
in python the general idea is
once you have a feature matrix like this you can use your favourite clustering algorithm for this i would use either kmeans directly or compute a similarity matrix for each pair of rows in the matrix compute the number of words in common and then use spectral clustering

good news for all
d finally after waiting a long time apple has introduced a parser comments for our projects
according to the new features in xcode 5
project documentation from framework api reference documentation and
structured comments in your own source code are displayed in the quick
help panel and in code completion popover views
doxygen and headerdoc
structured comments are supported formats
and from the clang 3.2 release notes
clang parses the comments and can detect syntactic and semantic errors
in comments
these warnings are off by default
pass -wdocumentation
flag to enable warnings about documentation comments
if you want to see an example of this new feature i recommend you take a look at the following article documentation in xcode 5
i can do this with a view setting include_docs true but i want couchdb to filter so i can use replication
you might already know this but you can use couchdb views as filters
also it would be possible to accomplish the same result if i could use a reduce function to filter data
the reduce function is for reducing the values that are returned by the map function
the map function returns a key and a value like so
emit key value
the reduce function only gets the keys and the values that are returned from a map function
for example if you call a view with
and it returns results like
you already have all the documents filtered by the key abc
the reduce function will get as inputs the key the value and a rereduce parameters
if you use the reduce function as a post map processing step to further filter the results from the view there will be two problems
there is no way to pass a parameter to a reduce
the keys that you specify will only be used by the map function and then passed as they are to reduce
it is not a good idea anyway
with reduce you want to return a small value that aggregates the results you get from a view
so taking the above example if you return say an integer as a value from the map function in emit key value suppose that the value is an integer the reduce function may return a sum or aggregate of those values
but trying to return a modified document is not what reduce function is for
from the docs
a reduce function must reduce the input values to a smaller output value
if you are building a composite return structure in your reduce or only transforming the values field rather than summarizing it you might be misusing this feature

list functions might be more suited to what you are trying to do
if you want to process the results of the view query before returning them they are they way to go
in list functions you get a set of results returned by the view function
you can even pass additional parameters if you d like to apply complex filters on them
but you won t be able to use list functions for replication
finally replication works on a document level
documents have _rev fields that is used by the replicator process to check what version the document is in before the replication is performed
so you won t be able to replicate the results returned by a view
only the documents will be replicated
no your use of strcat is not safe 7.21.3.1 2 if copying takes place between objects that overlap the behavior is undefined.
if you do a bit of looking you can probably find a few dozen or more implementations of this on the web one example
you can just ignore the fourth field
result
if your want to use only those lines with exactly three fields do this
elmah catches all exceptions thrown from your web app
if you want to filter out certain errors you could the error filtering feature of elmah as described here
in your case you would probably need to add something like this to your global.asax.cs
interesting benchmark
no surprise that sum is slower
here s how implementation looks like
as you can see it must be generic and uses meta programming
the result is bigger time cost
the results of the benchmark you pasted are clear and pretty self descriptive
if you really need better performance it seems that better idea is to use for loops
