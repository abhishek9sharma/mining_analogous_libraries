we have a bunch of small projects that have a single repository in gitorious
most of these repositories are really related
had the foresight been put into the original creation these would have all been created under the same project
now that there is all of this sprawl is there any way to keep the repositories or at least their history intact yet group them under a new project
an uiimage is not a view that can be added via interface builder
in order to display a uiimage you either need to override the drawrect method of whatever view you want to display it in or use a uiimageview
using a uiimageview will allow you to set it as an iboutlet and reference it in your controller

i know a site can have many apps but all the examples i see have the site called mysite
i figured the site would be the name of your site like stackoverflow for example
would you do that and then have apps like authentication questions and search
or would you really just have a site called mysite with one app called stackoverflow
given a string like documents filename txt i need to produce a new string documents filename_out txt where the new string simply appends _out to the filename while preserving the txt suffix
is there a way to say remove the last 4 characters txt from a string then append the string with _out txt
thanks in advance
simplified example the expression looks for a function named
the function will be searched for as a member function of std ostream and independently additionally via unqualified lookup triggering adl
the unqualified lookup via adl will find
the pure unqualified lookup no adl will start from the scope of the function body of print which is the scope of the class container and traverse the surrounding scopes until a function named is found
then it stops
here it stops at mynamespace as well this is the first surrounding scope that has a function with that name
the global namespace is not searched
you can make pure unqualified lookup find the global function e g
by saying you can think of it as here it might be clearer that the first surrounding scope of that contains a function named is mynamespace
imho a good solution would be to put the for the enum in mynamespace as well this way it can be found via adl
you can use the following
i know my title isn t quite specific and i m sure my question has already been asked somewhere but i don t know how to search for it

the default no parameter constructor is only provided if you have provided no others
if you define even a single constructor for your class you must use one of the explicitly defined ie in your code constructors to instantiate the object
you can of course define your own zero parameter empty constructor if that works for what you re trying to do

what you re looking for is a delegate
a delegate is essentially a method pointer which can be invoked later on
i m experiencing a weird problem
after hours of trial and error i ve found the root of the problem but it does not make any sense to me
i have a main class which has the following method i have a keys class
an object of the keys is added to an object of main
here is the minimal complete verifiable example main2 class keys class pressing the keys prints the values
so keys are working
notice that i ve changed the left method to call the static test method in the main class
right now as long as i don t press left button there is no problem but when i press left i only get the following result in the console neither end nor test method is called is printed
there is no error message
also after pressing left button all of the key methods stop working game loop still works so program is not frozen
mouse listener also stops working
i can t even close the jframe window by clicking the x button
however if i call the left method from the object of the main or another object or even from the start method it works with no errors and console gets the following message after that i can press the left button with no errors and get the same message
what is the reason for this
how can i fix this
edit i ve replaced my code with a mcve
as long as the user variable is in scope
i am planning to use netlink for communication between two userland processes
part of the reason being so picky about netlink is most of the processing for one of the process would eventually go in kernel space and netlink based communication can be used as it is hopefully
the approach i am taking is define a new generic netlink family i will have to write a kernel module just to support that family as it appears so at the moment
that is fine i was looking at some example code where kernel was essentially only routing messages between different processes and not really doing any work the actual population of those messages is handled by the processes
my question is is anyone using netlink in the similar manner in any of the projects
also does the above approach makes sense
i read about a proposal about netlink based dbus
but haven t found any implementation of that
that comes closest to my requirements
thanks
i m currently developing an app on our companies portal and yesterday started noticing that i wasn t able to reference external classes or methods from references
my colleague put the solution on his computer and committed his code with all the references working fine and i opened up his code and the references have stopped working and still can t be found
i have deleted the website cache and other user options but had no luck so far
one reference file is an external vb class file and the other was simply calling request from web ui usercontrols
i got around this by using httpcontext current request querystring even though request worked on my colleagues computer is there any options on my visual studio that would make the same code break compared to his
i contemplated a reinstall but it s a lot of time wasted and the problem may surface again

to keep it simple i ll use lodash here i used lodash simply because it provides a succint method for what in reality you re trying to do which is a union based on for example delimiters and transforms
a union is language independent the algorithm you use to implement the union will differ somewhat based on the language you choose
you can use that within a function where you define delimiters for example do i separate at a space
and transforms for example do the words have to be uppercase to match
try instead of set
first you re supposed to check to see what is supported before you try to create an image
you shouldn t rely on validation layers to stop you
that s just a debugging aid to catch something when you forgot to check
what is and is not supported is dynamic not static
it s based on your implementation
so you have to ask every time your application starts whether the formats you intend to use are available
and if they are not then you must plan accordingly
second yes if your implementation does not support 3 channel formats then you ll need to emulate them with a 4 channel format
you will have to re adjust your data to fit your new format
if you don t like doing that i m sure there are image editors you can use to load your image add an opaque alpha of 1 0 and save it again
oauth 2 0 bearer tokens allow you to insert them in an http authorization header as follows where abcdef123456 is your access token see in fact the spec says you should do that in lieu of request parameters if it is possible

if your net desktop application is used to show a notification when a user hits your predefined banking website
then given the effort required with the alternate answers from experience in finance wouldn t make more sense to make your application launch the link
then you could do your checks show the notification and if you launched the website with a unique querystring parameter generated from the desktop application users browsing the website would have an extra layer of security
if users dont have your application installed wont that defeat the point of doing all these checks to notify the user if antivirus or other security software are disabled once the user opens a bank website in the first place

to answer your question in your working code the difference is that you activate the finder before you issue the keystroke command
keystroke commands are always sent to the frontmost application so you must always make sure to activate an application first as you have done
if control 1 didn t work then i suspect either some finder command uses that combo or some other application uses that in a global context meaning it intercepts that command no matter which application is frontmost
otherwise it should work for you
finally i would remove your system events line of code from the finder tell block of code
there s no reason the tell the finder to tell system events to perform a command
just put that line on its own after the end tell line
good luck
it s hard to give you an exact answer without seeing more of the code but to give you a bit of direction i can make a few suggestions it sounds like an issue of specificity or precedence of order
this means that the styles from the theme are probably overriding your styles because they either are located somewhere that gives them a higher precedence embedded inline in a different stylesheet lower down in the file etc or the style declaration is more specific which causes it to take priority
i d say the best bet would be to really track down the hierarchy of the elements figure out the style declaration that is causing the grey color and then make sure to write a very specific declaration to target that element
if all else fails you can use color black
important
to force a higher precedence though this is usually best avoided if possible

i have implemented a 3rd party camera scanning app within a project of mine i have an adaptor that extends a viewholder so i can have a custom layout within a view i have a button when i create the view i add an onclicklistener to the image which i want to make clickable i want this onclicklistener to call the camera but i need to call an startactivityforresult i am confused about the placement of the onactivityresult when calling in this way
my current attempts have been to create a seperate class scan_activity which extends activity but i couldnt get the onclicklistener to start the class i have then attempted to declare it within the setonclicklistener which as you can guess also failed

i m guessing from the name of your binding handler that you used this bootstrap modal binding handler
unfortunately it has at least one typo
but it s at least a good start
when you have a particular problem like a modal won t open for you write a minimal example program
don t include anything that s not relevant to the problem you have
in this case all you should have is a modal and something to control it
that s not just for our benefit that s how you can solve your own problems
clear away all the other code that might interact in unpredictable ways with your issue
so here s some example code using that binding handler corrected
all i did was grab an example html for a bootstrap modal hook it up to the binding handler and make a button to toggle the modal controlling variable

as thiefmaster wrote above use local variables see there are lots of calculations inside your loops
could some of them be pre calculated
do you really need all those variables or could the temporary ones be omitted by writing slightly more complex expressions

example how could i select these elements in the most efficient way baring in mind the from and to are set dynamically
for information i have written a function used elsewhere to check if the bishop has moved diagonally to start with
i m not sure i understand your question completely but provided that you have the autoscroll working correctly and your problem is that your own painting code is not taking the scrolling into account then it is as easy as calling translatetransform with the autoscrollposition coordinates
then x2 and y2 can be obtained as hope this helps
as others have said insert first and add the index later
if the table already exists and you have to insert a pile of data like this drop all indexes and constraints insert the data then re apply first your indexes and then your constraints
you ll certainly want to do intermediate commits to help preclude the possibility that you ll run out of rollback segment space or something similar
if you re inserting this much data it might prove useful to look at using sqlloader to save yourself time and aggravation
i hope this helps

here is what was happening we have used rethinkdbdash to connect to rethinkdb database and we was using connection pool
there was a coding design issue
we have around 15 change feeds implemented with along with socket io
and the change feed was getting initialised for every user logged in
this was increasing number of active connections in the pool
and rethinkdbdash has default limit of 1000 connection in the pool and as there were lots of live connections all the available connection in the pool was getting exhausted resulting no more available connection
so request was waiting for an open connection and it was not getting any available hence waiting for ever blocking any new requests to be served

if you want to use unity you can import the following file formats fbx dae 3ds dxf obj from solidworks you can export as an stl then import the stl into a 3d application ex

if your css is constructed completely around ex or em units then this might be possible and feasible

you can t scale images this way though unless they get a style too

if everything can be a single task you can use the plugin to combine multiple streams into one
there is also a solution below if the tasks need to stay separate but please note that that method is a hack because it relies on a exposed property in gulp
without a hack solution using the output from one task in another would require intermediary storage like what you are doing with a file
single task solution here is a barebones demo using in your case and using the code in your question it would look like multiple task solution if your task structure is such that you can not merge them into a single task using the method above this is your best bet
it is a bit hacky in the sense that it relies on gulp tasks which is a non standard exposed property
there is no gurantee that this will work with future versions of gulp currently tested with gulp v3 8 10

i am studying for the spring core certification and i have the followind doubt with an exercice related to the beans configuration using the java configuration way
so i have the following rewardsconfig class that configure my beans this class is into the application folder src main java as you can see i declare 4 methods that are used to create 4 beans and that specify the dependency that occurs among these beans
so i have a rewardnetwork bean that is implemented by rewardnetworkimpl class that depends from the following 3 beans accountrepository restaurantrepository and rewardrepository
is it the correct interpretation of the java configuration is spring
can i say for example that rewardnetwork is the declared bean and that rewardnetworkimpl its the current implementation of this bean
all the 3beans accountrepository restaurantrepository and rewardrepository depends by another bean datasource that as you can see in the previous code snippet is declared as autowired this bean is not declared in this configuration class because it changes according to the environment test developt production
so in my case it is declared into the unit test folder src test java so the datasource bean define a datasource that is valid only for the test environment used when i perform a unit test
now my doubt is i have 2 different configuration classes and the datasource bean is not definied into the rewardsconfig configuration class that contains the 3 beans that use it
why i can t not use the import annotation to use it into rewardsconfig
something like it how it work exactly
tnx
module can have multiple meanings which generically means some type of software component which in some cases is just a file which could be a source file or an executable file or a collection of files perhaps all the files in a folder
another usage for the term modules refers to modular programming where modules are functions or a collection of functions which seems to fit with your example of a device composed of 7 modules
for windows in general each process has it s own virtual memory space while threads share the common virtual memory space of a process
in the case of embedded systems that only have a flat physical address space no virtual memory the main distinction is that processes are launched and in turn those processes launch threads
for some embedded systems the older term multi tasking is sometimes used to describe software especially in devices like hard drives where the main part of the multi tasking software is started up at boot time some diagnostic software can be dynamically loaded from protected areas of the hard drive and run as needed

need help in tweaking my logic little bit
as you see i have two foreach loop and both for different columns in gridview this code is in onrowupdating in the gridview for more info what exactly i am doing you can see the closed thread here the problem is on every loop i will be updating a row to db but since i have two different loop it will not exit till the first loop finishes
for an example i have _rpt count 2 so it will loop twice before it hit the second loop
is there a way that i can read both foreach loop values
i m posting to a user s wall using the post api
i want the message which gets posted to have line breaks and links
eg line 1 sid is is post title
line 2 venmo is
is post description line 3 and 4 see more and if you look to be post message
its a link and there is a line break
i want to achieve line 3
the documentation says post message is a json string so far i ve tried giving it html tags get stripped encoded tags tags get printed instead of actually applied nothing seems to be working
not sure how to go about this
ideas anyone
in xcode 4 the debug area closes every time i run an app even though i have the debug area open before i hit run
is there anyway to ensure that if i already have the debug area open that it will remain open when i run my app
this would save a lot of time as i wouldn t have to open it back up each time i execute code
i have to parse indian address just like google do i need some examples of how to parse an address
are there any examples of address parsing
are there any free dictionaries available of indian city locality states pincodes etc for example 5 802 vedvihar society near chandni chowk pune 411038 will parse to building street 5 house no 802 locality society vedvihar landmark chandni chowk city pune pin 411038
the problem was fixed by adding gem will_paginate in engine s gemfile even though gem will_paginate is in gemspec for the rails engine
the problem was caused by gem paginate was not loaded as activerecord base respond_to
paginate returned false
here is a post that is somewhat similar to the problem here
rails engine gems dependencies how to load them into the application
the problem is that you lose the reference to the from property
as soon as your othercontroller and dashboarddatepickerctrl starts they get a reference to the selecteddate from
but in your date change handler you are changing the from to another object in memory but the controllers are still pointing at the old one now lost in memory for ever quite dramatic
the easy way to fix it is to expose the entire selecteddate in the controller and bind to its subproperty
this way you will change the from but will not change the selecteddate
in your controller you should go with instead of and in your bind you should go as
this will solve the problem
if you mind a suggestion there is also ui bootstrap calendar directive
i ve talked a little about it at this answer
i am trying to get a diff between two branches in stash
specially before sending the pull request wanted to verify the changes
have been reading many articles trying to figure out a solution but haven t succeeded yet
here are the articles i have looked into git diff against a stash compare and diff for branches does anyone have a solution
we can t answer whether it will update every row or not
we don t know the data
if the exists predicate returns a true value each time then it will update every row
otherwise it won t
run this query first every row that is returned is one that would be updated
i almost always run a test select before i do any non trivial updates you can run the test select query after changing it to say wherenotexists to see which would not be updated
i have tried the following code you can see the results here so basically
important doesn t work in outlook 2010 it seems
how to do the above in a more compact way less code replication
use a canny edge detector
but in order to make it work well you ll have to read about the parameters that go into it and fiddle with them
i expect canny edge detection to do pretty well on this data set
if you wanna setup a new call while app is in background i dont see any proper way for this a lil hack could be getting location update because u can get location updates while app is in background and location service automatically wakes up your application when new location data arrives and small amount of time is given to application in which u can execute some code in that time you may start a new call
u can read further here search this starting the significant change location service in this link location aware programming guide and read the paragraph that is written after the code block
i have a docs collection and i have urls like this i d like to be able to identify the latest vs v0 0 27 part without having to use frontmatter on each page to specify it
is this possible
this answer is from here
while it used winforms instead of console application i think you will be able to use it
steps for creating dll step 1 file new project visual c projects class library
select your project name and appropriate directory click ok after clicking on button ok solution explorer adds one c class class1 cs
in this class we can write our code
when we double click on class1 cs we see a namespace creatingdll
we will be use this namespace in our project to access this class library
step 2 within class1 cs we create a method named sum that takes two integers value and return sum to witch method passed numbers
step 3 now build the application and see bin debug directory of our project
creatingdll dll is created
now we create another application and take this dll creatingdll dll reference for accessing dll s method
steps for accessing created dll step 4 file new project visual c projects windows form application
step 5 designed windows form as bellow figure
step 6 add reference of dll creatingdll which we created before few minutes
after adding reference of dll following windows will appear
step 7 write code on button click of windows form application
before creating object and making method of add dll add namespace createddll in project as bellow code
step 8 now build the application and execute project and see output
edit to change an application into a library do these steps first double click on properties inside solution explorer window
then on the openned page change the output type from console application to class library
i think you are on the right track but it sounds like your didn t stick we had to do the same thing to make qt happy with google breakpad and the icu library
we changed the zc wchar_t setting in and compiled qt from source and after that everything works
when you build your project that uses qt and boost you should see this option in the compiler output
something like if you ve already build qt without this option you may have to do a make confclean first to ensure everything really gets rebuilt with the new settings
it sounds like zc wchar_t will be the default in qt 5
imho it seems your entire problem arises because you are using cassetmanager

i would suggest making a directory under your application s root say and storing the post related files there
you can store paths for related post files in the db and retrieve the file when needed using that stored path
i m no expert just my suggestion
i m just getting started with watson conversation and i have a basic question
i set up an intent named play with several user phrases like please play the recipe notes and read me the recipe notes
do i also have to account for the singular version e g please play the recipe note
in other words is there an easier way to account for singular and plural input from the user
i found this question relative to regular expressions does watson conversation intents and entities support regular expressions
which seems to indicate that the only way to handle this is to enter the singular version in the intent and then add a input text matches notes in the dialog
is that the only solution
i m using ms sql server 2014
i have a table that tracks employees and every time a change is made in the application there is an effective date set and a new row is inserted it looks like this
i need to iterate through the table and if there is a change in job title insert a new row with a new start and end date and if there is not a new title then ignore the change unless it overwrites an effective date in the previous row
the last row of the employee group should set an end date of 1 1 2999
i have ssis or sql i can do this in but i m just not sure where to start or how to pull this off
after the process is completed the table result should look like the below
i guess you are probably using defaultmessagelistenercontainer
just to be sure you want that several individual components receive the same message i e
you don t want to process messages in parallel
assuming i got this right and component a and compoent b should receive the same message you simply create two defaultmessagelistenercontainer instance on the same topic and you set the pubsubdomain property to true
make sure you haven t set any concurrency on the listener container or better yet set the concurrency to 1 to make that explicit
this would give something like then you should create a similar bean for the second component
in more practical terms if you use mutliple os and editors such as at work i used rubymine on win xp and textmate on my macbook at home and one of our developers uses notepad and another aptana and we even have one who uses netbeans all of these editors interpret tabs differently different indentation but 2 spaces are always 2 spaces
also if you ever use haml or if you need to copy paste your code into some websites that try to colorcode your code 2 spaces are essential
i have an activity that switches between dual pane and single pane depending on orientation with a list fragment and a details view fragment i e
portrait single pane list fragment detail fragment when an item has been selected landscape dual pane list fragment and detail fragment i am getting the above error for the following use case in portrait single pane list click on item to launch details fragment rotate screen to landscape exception
i cannot see what s going wrong
seems like several people have had similar problems but not sure if it s quite the same
here is some code default activity_main xml landscape activity_main xml in mainactivity java
i d add to rex s and geoff s answers only one practical advice how to deal with ambiguities is to use type ascription anyway in this case using compare is probably the best solution as you are relying on scala s types
the c conversion reads the next single character from input regardless of what it is
in this case you ve previously read a number using d
you had to hit the enter key for that number to be read but you haven t done anything to read the new line from the input stream
therefore when you do the c conversion it reads that new line from the input stream without waiting for you to actually enter anything since there s already input waiting to be read
when you use s it skips across any leading white space to get some character other than white space
it treats a new line as white space so it implicitly skips across that waiting new line
since there s presumably nothing else waiting to be read it proceeds to wait for you to enter something as you apparently desire
if you want to use c for the conversion you could precede it with a space in the format string which will also skip across any white space in the stream

you can simple count your total lengths using inject if you want use your way you should define charcount before each block
i installed visual studio web developer in this case express edition and was reading through the eula
one thing that did not jump out at me was what i was allowed to use the software for private commercial etc
does anyone know if you are allowed to sell distribute the code you create in these express editions
i know they are geared toward the hobbyist and other software licenses like the student and teacher editions of office do not allow commercial use for the software
i d like to eventually start giving out code either via oss licenses like bsd or gpl and even maybe sell some code but not sure i can do that with the express editions
it is not entirely clear from your question what you are doing but i d recommend to simplify snow certainly works and works with rcpp as it does with other packages trust packages i found parallel computing setups easier when all nodes are identical local packages sets be careful with threading if you have trouble with explicit threading in the snow context try it first without it and the add it once the basic mechanics work

i want some custom authorization on my actions
i have googled a bit and there seems to be two options available
impelement logic in onactionexecuting in custom action filter see this post subclass authorizeattribute or implement iauthorization interface and put my logic there my question here is that which technique is preferable with pros and cons of using each technique edited moreover i can override onactionexecuting and onauthorization in my base controller that gives me benefit of accessing controller variables directly

when you join to a table already in the query the orm will assign the second one an alias in this case t3 which you can using in parameters to
to find out what the alias is you can drop into the shell and print qset query
see django documentation on f objects and extra update it seems you actually don t have to use or figure out what alias django uses because every time you refer to response__coding in your lookups django will use the alias created initially
here s one way to look for differences in either direction see django documentation on q objects btw if you are going to want both coding instances you have an n 1 queries problem here because django s won t get reverse fk relationships
but since you have the data in the query already you could retrieve the required information using the t3 alias as described above and
the value data from the corresponding coding record would be accessible as an attribute on the retrieved coding instance i e
as c other_value
incidentally your question is general enough but it looks like you have an entity attribute value schema which in an rdb scenario is generally considered an anti pattern
you might be better off long term and this query would be simpler with a risk field
you can use to populate your 2d char array level with the contents of level txt

why are you referring to unofficial examples rather than to the official web site
see to find out how to list all fields in an acroform getting their name and type
if you have checkboxes or radio fields you need to get the appearance state as shown in the same example
if you want to know the page number and position of each field you need this example look for the method that gets a fieldposition instance
if you want to know more about the flags that are set for the field password field multiline take a look at this example if you say mr
lowagie i will vote down your answer because you re giving me examples in java and i only accept c answers
please go to we ve invested in porting all the book example to c
all you have to do is to walk down the directory tree to find the corresponding examples
for instance if you say none of your examples work then maybe your form is an xfa form instead of an acroform
in that case there is no such thing as the position of the field
with xfa the pdf file acts as a container of an xml template and data set
this xml is rendered on the fly and the position of each field depends on the dataset
if your question is about xfa please reconsider
note that this answer costs me money as i m sharing knowledge you should have obtained from reading the book i wrote instead of asking a question that reveals you didn t do much effort to look for a solution yourself
i didn t downvote the question but i understand why somebody else would do so

i ve seen code like this my question is in the comment there in main
why can you call without specifying a type
intuition says it should be called like
but apparently does not have to be called like this the above compiles with gcc 4 7 for me either way with of without explicitly specifying the template and if you call it without specifying a type for the template what will the type of t be in the template function definition
i m guessing it defaults to the type of whatever it is you pass into the function mf as an argument but further explanation of how this works would be nice
problem resolution thanks to all
i think you should not use filters that way
filters are for transforming inputs based on optional params
the problem here would be that you re immediately returning a promise from the filter function
and that s nothing angular can deal with as a result from a filter
my suggestion therefore would be this fetch the result first work with the filter based on the result and in the template edit just read your explanation
to me this would be a candidate for a directive and in the template if you have a lot of companies you should preload the names maybe send them with the first response initially
as you d be bombarding your server quite a bit with requests
i am a total newbie with phonegap and struggling last 2 days with it
i found many tutorials on how to install it but none gave me the exact details so i combined them all to get it working
on some pages users write to install only phonegap and not cordova and phonegap and on other pages i see users write to install both
since documentation is really bad i am asking for info what is really correct
i am not a native developer for android so i decided to use phonegap in combination with javascript html php css
i created the project with this command in cmd after that i added the platform with i got a message after that i opened my project in eclipse android project from existing code and i got 28 warnings
i am not sure why and should this worry me but it makes me uncomfortable
warnings are any advice would really help me or any info are this warnings something that should worry me or is there way to avoid them

edit modified code and output to make it more clear edit 2 added example input for reproduction i have a json file and a csv file and i am running comparisons on the two

why is asset_ip becoming undefined
output assets json note that for the first iteration asset_ip will be undefined
i will therefore alter the code to only run the eq comparison if asset_ip is defined
however for this example i am not doing the check because all iterations are undefined

i have a feed aggregator that is organized by this general concept feed category books electronics etc feed site section home page books page etc feed the feed itself feed entry so make sense
now in my index page i want to basically say
if you are in the category books on the home page section give me the feed entries grouped by feed
in my controller in my view this partial will spit out the markup for each feed entry in the books collection of feeds
now what i need to do is somehow combine the books with the section
i tried this but it isn t limiting by the section id
i ve confirmed the section id by using the same code in the console
make sense
any advice
thanks
in the code you posted you don t have an you have an

my guess is you re not doing anything inherently wrong but that your version of pandas can t handle stata 13 dataset files
as documented in help dta the format of stata dta datasets changed with the release of stata 13
solution 1
update your pandas to v0 14 0 may 31 2014 read_stata now accepts stata 13 format gh4291 source solution 2
if you have access to stata there are several ways of reverting to earlier different formats that should work with your earlier version of pandas
see this answer read stata file in r edit solution 3
after some discussion in github the problem pandas seems to have with stata 13 datasets are string variables
so another solution could be converting the string to numeric type
see help encode which will create appropiate value labels
or maybe help real or help destring if the strings happen to be just numbers in string type

i have some images in a large set of images that have a white or black border that surrounds the image itself
how can i
crop the image to a size without said background border resize the image to fill a given output size centered
for example i have an uploaded image that is 1280x1024px in size this has a white or black border where the interior size is say 800x700 may not be centered i want to crop out that border then resize to fill a 640x480 output
this will effectively take the interior image then fill the 640x480 effectively cropping an additional 100px of height from the original

i believe that an exception should be something you don t expect
if you expect an exception then you should do something with it
so in your first example i think you should probably not bother catching the ioexception if you are also stating that your method is going to throw ioexception

you could add an on update trigger that fails when the inserted table has above x number of rows though then later if you really did want to make the change you ll need to disable renable the trigger not hard but annoying which is what you re after i suppose
but yes if you re doing things manually they should be in a begin tran rollback transaction with a select at the end to verify what you were doing and only after you re happy with it then commit it
we can probably all tell you of at least one case where we thought we were happy with it and still committed it incorrectly though haha

when i try to create a new device loop8 by calling a device seems to be created but it doesn t work as intended
first as shown on the link we can see loop8
terminal output picture however using losetup on the two creates different outputs as below
now let me create two files and setup the two loop devices
as in the link loop0 succeeds while loop8 fails two device comparison why is this the case
ps
on an extra note if i restart the computer it always has loop0loop7 even if you create or remove any loop devices
furthermore as shown in the first link the time they are edited are all at bootup
finally even if you setup dev loop0 with a file after computer reboot despite dev loop0 existing dev loop0 is no longer set up
i have no idea why these are happening

i have developed my first flex mobile application which is of tabbedviewnavigatorapplication
application is working fine but when i test the application in profile handler memory usage goes on increasing as i navigate through the application
when i came to know that i have to remove all the added eventlisteners and i have to nullify the objects which are no longer needed
when i switch between tabs tabs are initialising again and again
i dont know where can i remove the eventlisteners
i mean i have written functions for each eventlisteners
do i need to remove eventlistener when control goes to the function definition
i have written sample code also do i need to explicitly nullify the object of image class which i created or garbage collector will handle it
if i need to explicitly nullify it where to do this
thanks
when you add a widget as a child to another widget the containing class will first do a removefromparent operation
so no you can not add a widget twice
why would you want to do that
maybe that is the right question to ask
if you don t want to update the status on multiple locations on the screen then maybe you need to apply an observer pattern to your data and update all the observers when the data changes

apologies if there are already answers out there for this but i ve dug a lot and found little
i m trying to implement a watchdog system on a c net 4 5 windows forms application
basically i have a form with various buttons text displays etc that connects to an external device
i have a timer on the main form that should check the device for changes every 250ms or so
i ve lumped all mainpage form code including the timer into one class and the code for the external device into its own class that inherits from mainpage
trouble is i want to be able to have the timer s tick function call a method from the device class
here s simplified code naturally i can t call device devicecheck from within the timer because it s not static
however if i declare devicecheck static i now get an error that textbox_status is not static
if i try to declare it static visual studio gets very mad at me
originally i had dumped everything into the same class and it all worked fine but that is very ugly code
is there a better way
edit the extra snag more than one thing in the form that needs to be changed by devicecheck so what i left out of the simplified code in addition to the settextbox method i also have a method in the form that sets some indicators based on information from devicecheck naturally all my indicators are also put in place when i construct the form so they can t be static either
so having devicecheck return the string message to be displayed works but i can t really have it also return the string that uses

i could by returning a struct with multiple strings but is there a better way
edit here s my working solution based on eric s advice i start out with a struct for the status elements the indicators now grab the messages from status and the timer just calls the devicecheck method and sets the indicators finally devicecheck sets values for the status struct which is public static and inherited by the device class this works pretty seamlessly
in the end i didn t need to return values from devicecheck after all
i ll still mark that idea as accepted though since it led me in the right direction

is it possible for the seperate users to see the unique changes they made to django admin
for example if user1 has added some products or categories to be able to see his unique changes admin site
if it s not how could i construct such a feature using the django admin as a base
it seems to me that you could use mock to do the work assuming that you have it installed and that you have all the setup py requirements
the idea here is to just mock out setuptools setup and inspect what arguments it was called with
of course you wouldn t really need mock to do this you could monkey patch setuptools directly if you wanted
this is the select i m doing the table gestiondoc_publicados_tags is like the table gestiondoc_publicados_permisos is like i want to get every tag where the id_publicado is equal to the id_publicado where cargo is equal to cargo1 but i m only getting tag1 as the result how can i do the query properly
i am using multiple options for select2 and the data is loaded from a json source
as i m not sure how to explain it exactly i ll provide an example list options a b c if i choose c then results c if i then choose a i would get a c if i then choose b i get a b c i would preferably want it to append so i would get c a b
however being able to find the last selected option would be alright
i have tried last and other answers but nothing seems to work
i ve noticed in previous versions of select2 this issue was not present
downgrading is not an option
thanks in advance
my script for select2
u need two xml attributes also to achieve this add them to the edittext as well as the parent layouts any layout inside which these views are
by default these are false so the focus is not given to the requested view
source after u show the edittext based on the checkbox selection add the next and previous focus points dynamically in code
hope this helps
when you are doing the animation with the images you have to add those images in array smartly
your code looks fine
only one line in which i have doubt is all other is fine
just check whether the images are arranged in the order or not
im using image crud to handle a images gallery upload is correct insert into table is correct but displaying thumnbails images is wrong this is an example of the url for image thumbnails that image crud generates does anyone know the reason or how can fix this
unsure if php s xpath supports this but this xpath does the trick for me in scrapy python based scraping framework if this doesn t work try kristoffers solution or you could also use a regex solution
for example that ll remove any html tag with any content in it excluding text which is not encapsulated by html tags
assuming you don t want to use line height you can also try
you could try system reflection methodbase getcurrentmethod and then use the returned methods getparameters function
having said that there is some confusion disagreement as to whether or not this will actually work but it is probably worth a try if for no other reason than to eliminate it as a possibility
i m attempting to install pyopencv
i have installed both python and opencv through brew
a quick which python pip shows that i m using the version of python installed through brew as the default
i have already installed numpy through pip
however when i try to run pip install pyopencv i get back a semi related question had the same error but under a different circumstance
the problem here appears to have been with the virtual environment and they were using the pre installed version of python rather than the brew version
any suggestions as to how i might fix this
thank you much
update according to this question solution when a could not find a version that satisfies the requirement error arises it s because pip will only install stable versions as specified by pep426 by default
if a version cannot be parsed as a compliant pep426 version then it is assumed to be a pre release
this can be worked around using to install pre release packages
however upon doing this or attempting to install pyopencv using easy_install i run into the error importerror cannot import name library
update 2 further research into this new error presented this question solution
here the importerror cannot import name library comes from the new version of setuptools having the library is inside of extension py
such that pyopencv should import library as setuptools extension library and not setuptools library
a temporary solution to this would be to manually change this
however i d prefer a more appropriate solution if one exists over manually editing 3rd party packages
any suggestions
thanks
update 3 if opencv and python were install correctly through brew it appears you can use opencv in python simply by importing the cv2 module as was discovered in the comments
so that solves my problem
however for others who may actually need pyopencv for something i ll leave this question open
have a look at this related issue
if i might offer an alternative use epplus and its great loadfromdatatable function this would reduce your code to one line it is magnitudes faster and it does not rely on excel directly

hi i ve been trying to write numbers on imageview
images for n number of questions
if the user entered answer is correct then it should be displayed with question number with tick mark image else question number with wrong mark image
i need to write the question number on the image
the example of this my code is here i get this warning there is no image show at run time
what am i doing wrong
there s no in place array sorting in mongodb
read that array into php or whatever sort it there and save back
when you later will read that array it will stay sorted
in python it means what you tell it to mean
underscores are valid characters in a name
however if you are using ipython see martin s fine answer that said they do have some special semantics
starting a name with a single underscore doesn t do anything programmatically different but by convention it tells you the name is intended to be private
but if you start a name with two underscores the interpreter will obfuscate it

i am looking for some way to store my data on server till the time its up and running somewhat like global class and variables in c
we store all in the isolation storage we are running with clickonce
we have some object that we serialize xmlserializer
in order to display id 2 or any other from json it s necessary to search the id like this will display fila notice how each field in the data becomes a property in json id becomes record id
you could use classes for your data points
in this case the memory will be allocated on the heap
but considering that you are talking about 500 million data points and especially since you are programming in the net world with a more restricted memory limit for apps i would strongly encourage using some kind of embedded database like sqlite for example
in this way you would avoid having all of your data points in memory simultaneously but only the ones you need for computation now

using pure css you can sort of rely on the cascade to determine whether a browser understands supports by making a supports rule with a universally supported declaration such as a color declaration and overriding another such rule that is declared globally in any browser that implements supports correctly test should have green text
otherwise it ll have red text
see my answer to this question for a detailed explanation of the pure css method
if you re looking to detect it using javascript you can use the modernizr feature detection library as mentioned in the comments be sure to include css supports in your download config

when you execute the commit statement all the cached data from sga commited and uncommited goes to the online redo log files of your database
this work is done by lgwr log writer process
so all the data even undo data is protected by the online redo log files
the dbwr database writer process uses lazy algorithm to store your data to the data files
it writes data into the data files every 3 sec by default you can customize this value or if your buffer is filled up to 80 or if a checkpoint occurs
so if you loose electricity next time during the database starting your data from online redo will be roll forwarded from the online redo log files and then roll backed all the uncommitted transactions your undo data is also protected by online redo log files
about your example if you don t commit your transaction you will not find the updated data after the database recovering
if your a value has been changed by a different dml this data also will be stored in online redo log files so at first your update will be roll forwarded then the dml that changed the a value will be roll forwarded

indeed you can t use jinja in the same way as you would use python

we can change the assignment to capture the full new state of samplelist in that way
i have 3 forms
a form is the parent and the others are inserted as subforms of the parent i have programmed the current event in form f_c1 so when the user changes the selected row in f_c1 some data should be copied to f_c2 but that returns an error 2455 the error seems to be in the form part since this works but this doesn t work in other words it looks like it is not possible to get into a child of the parent
what can be happening
note f_c1 is bound to the parent via a common field f_c2 is not bound to the parent
i use f_c2 just as a scrollable container of controls
note 2 i have made a test in a new blank form f_p_test i have inserted the form f_c2 two times f_c2_a and f_c2_b
i have configured the click event on a checkbox of f_c2 so the event is available in both f_c2_a and f_c2_b
in this test i can access f_c2_a fields from f_c2_b fields and vice versa
update i ve just tried a trick but it doesn t work i have added a button to the parent form and asigned an event to it so when i click the button the values of f_c2 textboxes are shown
the results if i manually click on the button then the values are shown
but if i add a click simulation to the current event of form f_c1 then the information is not shown the same old error happens
incredible
update 2 solved it was a race condition
the parent form is opened by other form with so the children subforms f_c1 and f_c2 are opened just after the parent but the children are not loaded at the same time
when child f_c1 is loaded its current event is run and it tries to access to f_c2 but f_c2 is still not loaded so the folloging code fails the solution is to detect that f_c2 is still not loaded fortunatelly the f_c1 s form_current event is called two times automatically when the parent form f_p is opened the first time f_c2 is still not loaded
the second time f_c2 is already loaded so f_c1 data is successfully copied to controls of f_c2

i have a downloaded csv file which i would like to parse and use to create json objects for each record
the file is on my local machine but i have read that javascript has security measures in place that prevent access to these files
some examples show using csv js with the following when running this it just creates a get request in the console
i am treading on unfamiliar territory here so any explanations would be great
if i was to do this using ruby i would do this which hopefully will give you an indication of what i am trying to achieve end i m hoping this makes sense and someone can point me in the right direction
well all forms of hashing are murder on caches
anyways you can easily combine the two into a single table
but then how do you tell whether you re on your first hash function or the second
the options are add that as metadata to every bucket or else figure it out by running the first hash function seeing whether you got the current location and running the second only if you were on the first
that either requires extra space or running more hash functions
splitting the table into 2 solves that problem more efficiently
and statistically you need the same number of buckets to store the same number of things whether or not the table has been split
so your whole hash table becomes smaller
i have modified your fiddle
and it is working now as you said
other answers have already dug into how you can often code complex behavior with simple code that just reacts to the pattern of its particular input
you can think of the data as a domain specific language and of your code as an interpreter maybe a trivial one
given lots of data you can go further the statistics can power decisions
peter norvig wrote a great chapter illustrating this theme in beautiful data with text code and data all available online
disclosure i m thanked in the acknowledgements on pp
238 239 how does the data driven approach compare to a more traditional software development process wherein the programmer codes explicit rules
clearly the handwritten rules are difficult to develop and maintain
the big advantage of the data driven method is that so much knowledge is encoded in the data and new knowledge can be added just by collecting more data
but another advantage is that while the data can be massive the code is succinct about 50 lines for correct compared to over 1 500 for ht dig s spelling code
another issue is portability
if we wanted a latvian spelling corrector the english metaphone rules would be of little use
to port the data driven correct algorithm to another language all we need is a large corpus of latvian
the code remains unchanged
he shows this concretely with code in python using a dataset collected at google
besides spelling correction there s code to segment words and to decipher cryptograms in just a couple pages again where grady booch s book spent dozens without even finishing it
the unreasonable effectiveness of data develops the same theme more broadly without all the nuts and bolts
i ve taken this approach in my work for another search company and i think it s still underexploited compared to table driven dsl programming because most of us weren t swimming in data so much until the last decade or two
it sounds like you are expecting this to free just part of the memory allocated by new int 10
this is not the case it causes undefined behavior and could cause anything to happen
on some memory managers if you ask them to free a block by passing a pointer if you don t pass a pointer to the beginning of the block then they may free the entire block that contains the pointer that you pass
this may well be happening in your case
another consideration is that new int 10 does not initialize the memory allocated so the operating system can just allocate some address space and doesn t need to back the allocation with any physical storage
this means that even if you call new int 10 in a loop without any delete you may see no rising memory usage in many memory monitoring tools even up to the point when new throws a std bad_alloc exception when you exhaust the logicalbvg address space
this is likely to take some time just allocating 10 bytes at a time

my problem is that i don t know how to integrate it in wordpress query
another possibility is to load them from database one by one but i m afraid that it can slow down page loading i m talking about 8 10 pages max

the first argument is the maximum heap size and the second is the start that you are setting
max should be bigger than start

just right click the project in visual studio and select publish
this will publish the required files to a folder from where you can upload them
a couple of points to note
set the build config to release before running publish
this substitutes in the values in your web release config file which sets debug to false by default but you can also put in server connection strings and other production settings

to include a referenced dll select it in the reference folder and set its copy local property to true

but i am new to python and like to use equality conditions in my program and has hit a very surprising road block
while the practical issue here is that the last condition is not satisfied and i will miss out on an iteration of the loop but that is not what is worrying me
rather than trivial work arounds can someone explain to me what is going on in simple terms
also why the numbers turn out the same no matter how many times i run this loop therefore it is something systematic and not something probabilistic
and a proper way to make sure this does not happen what i mean by proper is a programming practice i should adopt in all my coding so that such unintentional discrepancy does not occur ever again
i mean such loops are omnipresent in my codes and it makes me worried
it seems i cannot trust numbers in python which would make it useless as a computational tool
ps i am working on a scientific computing project with numpy

for the sake of anyone searching this whilst only a temporary solution i used probability mass functions to get ratios this allowed the user to modify the mean and sd and thus skew the curve as they wished
i could then use the ratios for my calculations

i have a table view in an iphone xcode tab bar application that shows data either alphabetically or numerically depending on a user selected option in one of the tabs
it works for the most part but when i change the option and then go back into the table view the table view initially looks like it did before the option was changed
however as new cells get scrolled into view they have the new display mode
i can identify when the option changes but i can t seem to get the code correct that would re initialize the cells such that the next time they come into view they have the correct values
the data comes from a static array with set values so i don t want to do anything with the data source just the table view
in other words once the display option changes i want to wipe out the table view i have so that the next time the table view displays it will show the correct data right from the start rather than after scrolling occurs
any help would be appreciated
thanks
generics in java are very different from generics in net because there is no type erasure in net
you can specify that you are returning a list of iemumerable and then add list objects to your list
because list implements iemumerable this is not an error
in your case however an object of type selectlist is added
i would make a guess and say that selectlist implements an ienumerable of selectlistitem or inherits a class that does it
i would also guess that there are other classes that work as a supply of selectlistitems in addition to the selectlist
since the list returned from your method specifies an instance of a generic interface rather than a class as the list element type you can mix and match different implementations of ienumerable in the same list
you declare the update variable inside a function
the other function can t access it s value

i d take another route use settimeout

yes you could have a state machine in prolog there are several questions about making one here on stackoverflow
i d suggest that while it s true a cpu is a finite state machine it could easily be a large one the commonly used 8051 controller has 15 bytes of registers
since it s reasonable for rough estimate to assume any one could assume any value 1
x is 2 158
x 1329227995784915872903807060280344576
states
and that s without modeling the external memory
you may have trouble finding a machine with that much memory
where you might find a use for state machines is in interpreting individual instructions
so if you re brand new to prolog i d suggest a bit more learning before attempting something of this scope
i started with a game to play tic tac toe

i did my research and the final answer was matching the correct aria attributes and some html5
for lists not that i am aware of but depending on your data volume it might be efficient for you to re cast your data to use redis multiset command hmset which does indeed give you multiple inserts in a single call as you expect hmset creates the redis keyed to v3620
the key follows the hmset command followed by multiple field value pairs
use binding annotations to differentiate each xmlformatter
in your module and of course you ll have to define pretty and compact annotations

so in case of sending a campaign i cannot specify all recipients inline but have to make a single api call for every message wich is bad for say 10 100k recipients
but now all transmission_id are unique for every single recipient so i have the missing key and rcpt_meta is not needed anymore
so the key to be used when receiving a webhook is composed
i ve got a single page where it checks a slug
if this slug can not be found in a database table the single page should render the 404 page
something like this i have tried now this goes to your active package single pages directory packages your_pkg_handle single_pages page_not_found php
it should go to the active theme instead though
i have tried setting the second parameter to null as i thought that would be the pkghandle but no result
obviously i m missing something or this is not possible
i m using slf4j with log4j and i have the following situation as it can be seen package is x y z base
now i have several classes which extend this base class these classes are currently in packages x y z classa x y z clasb
etc
i want separate log file for each of these classes as they act as separate modules
but what i also want is to somehow put log from base class to these separate logs depending on which class is being used that is i don t want log form base class in all logs if only one subclass is executing
for example if i have extended class and make the following code sequence i d like to have the log file for this case as follows possible info warnings errors from connect possible info warnings errors from dosomething possible info warnings errors from disconnect this should be the case for all extended classes where dosomething is class specific method
any way to organize packages configure log4j for this behavior
thanks

having made a similar transition the more you look into it the more you do have to think about c s gc behaviour in all but the most straighforward cases
this is especially true when trying to handle unmanaged resources from managed code
this article highlights a lot of the issues you may be interested in
personally i miss a reference counted alternative to idisposable more like shared_ptr but that s probably a hangover from a c background
the more i have to write my own plumbing to support c like programming the more likely it is there is another c mechanism i ve overlooked or i end up getting frustrated with c
for example swap and move are not common idioms in c as far as i ve seen and i miss them other programmers with a c background may well disagree about how useful those idioms are

instead of thinking of every special characters and adding them up do it the other way
count every letters digits and subtract them from the count
you can do that with a simple one liner which you can also change to
no such thing as query and
get conjunction by qualifying a single query since both tests are about the contents of the channels column presumably an array then the single query can be qualified with a single condition i suggest you get your query working as above with a few hard coded variables that you know are in the data
once you know the query works you can then concentrate on making sure you call the function properly
so i have a string which is around 3800 characters it s sentences words etc
now i m running the string through something although the limit is 1000 so how could i break the string into 4 pieces each containing a maximum of 1000 characters and not breaking words in half is there any way to do it
thanks
when using auto_increment make the field primary key
also remove the extra after the last field definition
try this
there is nothing like this on windows phone
another option and what i usually do myself purely for personal preference is something like in the controller again this code is untested but the general idea should work
exceptions are a way of handing error situations
the alternative are return values and lots of ifs and switch cases
it is true that the exception acts like a hidden goto but the final code is easier to maintain then it s alternative
handling exceptions is fairly easy
all exceptions that are thrown in the code should have a common base class which logs the error
all exceptions should carry enough information what exactly happened
it is also true that the exceptions should not be misused in a way that they should be thrown for every little thing
if possible error should be handled locally
if not throw an exception which will be caught at the level where the exception can be dealt with
and the final note c without exceptions is not c it is a c with classes

i am using a yootheme template yoo_master2 and i created a new style for my site by going to extensions templates select styles from the left menu select template name options settings customiser i then made the changes required and saved the changes as a new style and applied them to my site
the problem i am having is i cannot find the newly created css file anywhere in my file directory
can someone tell me where i can find it please
the yootheme documentation says this the styles style name layouts folder of your theme is at the top of the hierarchy and modifications or additions you make here will override all other theme files
also this folder will be preserved during updates so it s the safest place to make your modifications but i don t seem to have a styles folder anywhere
appreciate your help many thanks luke
1 would a handshake be negotiated on every request
there are two issues here most browsers don t need to re establish a new connection between requests to the same site even with plain http
http connections can be kept alive so no you don t need to close the connection after each http request response you can re use a single connection for multiple requests
you can also avoid to perform multiple handshake when parallel or subsequent ssl tls connections are required
there are multiple techniques explained in imperialviolet overclocking ssl definitely relevant for this question written by google engineers in particular session resumption and false start
as far as i know most modern browsers support at least session resumption
these techniques don t get rid of new handshakes completely but reduce their cost
apart from session reuse ocsp stapling to check the certificate revocation status and elliptic curves cipher suites can be used to reduce the key exchange overhead during the handshake when perfect forward secrecy is required
these techniques also depend on browser support
there will still be an overhead and if you need massive web farms this could still be a problem but such a deployment is possible nowadays and some large companies do it whereas it would have been considered inconceivable a few years ago
2 will all assets need to be encrypted
yes as always
if you serve a page over https all the resources it uses iframe scripts stylesheets images any ajax request need to be using https
this is mainly because there is no way to show the user which part of the page can be trusted and which can t
3 would browsers not cache https content including assets
yes they will you can either use explicitly to serve your assets or assume that the browser will do so
in fact you should prevent caching for sensitive resources 4 is downstream transparent proxies not caching https content including assets css js etc still an issue
http proxy servers merely relay the ssl tls connection without looking into them
however some cdns also provide https access all the links on google libraries api are available via which combined with in browser caching allows for better performance
5 would all external assets tracking pixels videos etc need to have https version
yes this goes with point 3
the fact that youtube supports https access helps
6 https and gzip might not be happy together
they re independent
https is http over tls the gzip compression happens at the http level
note that you can compress the ssl tls connection directly but this is rarely used you might as well use gzip compression at the http level if you need there s little point compressing twice
7 backlinks and organic links will always be http so you will be 301 ing all the time does this impact seo

the easiest way is
something like this

byte 3600 to 3700 if you need line offset instead of byte you might have to resort to e g
sed depending all on what you are going to use the data for it is also a good candidate for a short c program

you may need to give the nested fields like it s a bit clunky unfortunately
but if you just want the whole assignee you can use
hope that helps
you could use cross join to insert nxm rows where n is the number of rows in temp1 and m the number of rows in temp2 if the rows in both temporary tables are related use a regular join this usually inserts less than nxm rows
i want to change my computer s system registry value via vb net i ve tried the above however it gives no error but it simply doesn t change the value
piece of my code one element of array childs is uninitialized in stderr but result of print is ok
after join results in about a 2450 2452 2454 2456
why so
i understand that the problem in the loop but i seem to be doing everything correctly
i need string like 2450 2452 2454 2456
try this selector online demo here
the only issue is that it will also include the leading whitespace but you can use something like python s to remove it afterwards
you will have at least two insert statements and more when _post measures or _post c_objectives grow
you can insert multiple records with one statement and instead of using a for statement use a foreach so you don t have to do the bookkeeping on the iterator variable
then store values in arrays and use implode to combine the sets of values for each record
check which values are being inserted into which columns it appears that in the first for loop of your example you are inserting the value from _post sno i into the id field

i am having what seems an easy problem to solve but i don t know the correct way to solve it
i ve been googling for a solution for almost a week without luck
all i found was this but had no clear and clean solution i have created a two node cluster not for production with the following configuration on both nodes debian wheezy 7 7 corosync v2 3 4 pacemaker v1 1 12 libqb v0 17 1 cluster glue v1 0 12 resource agents v3 9 6 crmsh v2 1 0 i ve installed the cluster software from source following this guide to compile cluster softwares on debian before installing i made sure there were no older corosync or pacemaker dependencies
after the installation i configured my cluster editing the file on both nodes corosync conf and creating and copying the authkey i ve configured the resources on pacemaker after all the configuratins i ve started both corosync and pacemaker with the cluster is up and running but i can t find a way to start the cluster at boot time i ve tried adding the init d scripts to runlevels but i get no response and no effect on corosync and this error on pacemaker i ve followed the guide on clusterlabs but i can t find a solution for debian and crmsh on the official guide they use pcs instead of crmsh but even with that i could not find the correct procedure to make the cluster run at boot time another info i can add is i ve also tried to use crmsh to start and run the cluster trying to find a way to make it run at boot time
if i run crm cluster start instead of the init d scripts corosync and pacemaker start and the cluster starts running but if i run the command to stop i get this error what is the correct way to make the cluster run at boot time
what daemon must be started and enabled
should pacemaker be started by corosync
i ve found this guide but the parameters mentioned service name and service ver don t work in my corosync configuration
hope somebody could help me with this issue thanks in advance
background in web 1 0 applications it is common to see pagination used to limit the browser from displaying all of the data in a set all at once
pagination allows a subset of the data to be displayed on the page which reduces the memory footprint and decreases the lag time caused by too much visible markup being displayed in the dom
pagination involves next and prev links as controls in which a user uses to traverse through the data
this technique is facilitated through either full page reloads where clicking next reloads the page with the next data subset or it s facilitated through ajax where the application replaces a portion of the page with the next set of data
some infinite scrolling plugins such as the infinite scrolling a jquery plugin simply extend this type of pagination by hiding the prev and next hyperlinks and automating the click through process by monitoring the scrolltop position while others do not
thus for websites and web applications with an existing legacy pagination technique a plugin that extends existing functionality may be more desirable
example of the infinite scrolling technique an real life example of the infinite scrolling technique is found here infinite scrolling plugins below is a list of some widely known infinite scrolling plugins infinite scrolling for angularjs paul irish s jquery infinite scroll unmaintained infinite scroll wordpress plugin infinite ajax scroll a jquery plugin 12 jquery infinite scrolling plugins for content navigation ben nadel s two way technique with infinite scrolling both up as well as down when should i use this tag
you should use the infinite scroll tag on questions where you know or reasonably believe through trial and error that the problem you re facing is related to an infinite scroll plugin or an infinite scroll technique
for example this question is asked by a user who was having problems getting the jquery infinite scroll plugin to work
the error the user is seeing only appears when the plugin is loaded which implies that the plugin is involved in the problem
it s not helpful to tag a question with a tag that isn t specifically involved in the problem so an example of a situation where i wouldn t use the tag would be if the infinite scroll plugin or technique was working great yet i had problems making an ajax call to the server
additionally the problem occurs with or without the plugin
therefore i would not use that tag in this specific scenario
advanced techniques the majority of the infinite scroll plugins that exist in general only offer one way scrolling functionality
in other words as the user scrolls down more content is added
however in most cases the content above the visible viewing area remains actively loaded in the dom
as users scroll down long enough they may begin to experience a lag as more and more memory is consumed by the browser
with enough content this could theoretically cause a browser crash
ben nadel writes a blog post covering bidirectional infinite scroll
while there is no demo in the blog post he includes a video that demonstrates the technique
for bidirectional scroll there exists no plug in at this time at least none that are easy to find
the bidirectional technique is much harder to implement than the one way technique
the difficulty comes not from implementing two directions per se but instead the difficulty manifests itself when attempting to implement scrolling that loads content above the visible area such as when the user scrolls up
when scrolling down new content added to the page does not affect the visible viewing area
while users may see the scrollbar move the content itself is not affected
but when content is loaded on top the visible scroll area shifts and the user experiences a jarring effect
ben nadel s technique involves storing the scrolltop position prior to loading in new content on top and then once the content loads a new scrolltop is quickly calculated before the user experiences any side effects
instead of mousedown event i would rather use dragstart dragend drag events
you could also replace click with dblclick if that does not impact the user experience you want to present to your users
i do not know how click interacts with the drag event

there s a couple ways to deal with borders 1 crop just get rid of the pixels
typically implemented in software as filling in these outside values as 0s
example 2 extend simply copy the nearest edge pixels to the out of bounds areas
example or keep going for however far your neighborhood kernel needs to be
3 wrap just like pacman
example in this case i arbitrarily chose to wrap diagonally copied opposite corners
some people like to interpolate the corners
i think this type of edge handling can be particularly useful if you plan on doing a fourier transform on your data or maybe if it s already in frequency space same idea as any type of spectral periodic wrapping but i m not really sure i ve never used it in practice
4 reflection this is a method i ve also never used but have heard of it
for example i chose not to pad in the top bottom there as it would be verbose
it gets kind of tricking doing off diagonals with some of these methods as well
you can either extend columns as needed to try to find the diagonals you might need or interpolate to get the value

when i run my application after some second this exception occurred
what is exception and how i can handle this exception the clr has been unable to transition from com context 0x647f10 to com context 0x648080 for 60 seconds
the thread that owns the destination context apartment is most likely either doing a non pumping wait or processing a very long running operation without pumping windows messages
this situation generally has a negative performance impact and may even lead to the application becoming non responsive or memory usage accumulating continually over time
to avoid this problem all single threaded apartment sta threads should use pumping wait primitives such as cowaitformultiplehandles and routinely pump messages during long running operations

what i want to do is check different things in the most accurate order 1 check if first name last name and middle name are in email 2 check if first name and last name are in email 3 check if first name last initial 4 check if first initial last name 5 check if first name 6 check if last name would it be multiple searches throughout the email with like 6 different regex searches or is there a way to do one search on every email and see if it hits any of the groups in the pattern right now in my code i just have a first name and last name searching that gets none right at all

the thing is though there are a shit ton of names and even more emails so i dont know the general case
but i feel like it would suffice if i looked for firstname lastname email then firstinitiallastname email then middleinitallastname email and then the worst case would just be lastname email

expressing my doubt that you will actually need to process strings of compound tuples the solution you are looking for is raw_input instead of input and ast which is what input does
now when the two tuples are understood separately the program may now process numbers with more than two digits

create a default comparator
the behavior of the default comparator is to look and see if the two objects are comparable
if so compare them if not throw an exception
assign this comparator to an instance variable in your class
then you have two choices
either create the class with an optional comparator in which case you replace the default one and your comparison code just uses whichever comparator is assigned to that instance variable or your comparison method optionally takes a comparator and you use the one passed in or your default if none was passed
which of these approaches to use would depend on how your class is called
this way allows you to keep a table row on the same line in your source code

if your application requires that some numeric identifier on a table is sequential without gaps then you will need another way of generating those identifiers
ruby uses a different syntax for recursion replaces

i m trying to implement dynamic security on a cube where an employer should be able to see the measures associated with all the employees under him
i m doing this by first getting the login credentials of the logged in user using and then getting the descendants of that user
however i m having an issue because the descendants in the employee dimension are defined on empid attribute whereas the gives the login id attribute
i m not able to use descendants function on login id attribute
i e works but doesn t work
so how can i get the empid attribute based on the login id
any ideas please
change this into
in my opinion the answer to your question is sozialize
you have a user story that s great
start to promote your ideas on facebook on twitter your blog user communities and show your passion
spread your word to get followers and finally coders as well
the rest depends on the size of your project in mind and how interesting your ideas are for others
forget it if you re just looking for someone who does free coding for you
it wont work
don t waste your time and better learn to code yourself
even you might find some better code sharing platforms to promote your open source ideas you wont succeed because nobody cares
i could name you code plex sourceforge and other alternatives to startup an open source project but they are all just tools for sharing code each with its own advantages and disadvantages but none of them helps to get you started
but if you are serious rather than starting a new project i would start looking what others are doing with similar projects and get involved
you don t have to be a developer
contribute as a user report bugs help others promote your ideas contribute to documentation read the mailing lists meet the developers watch their chat in irc and don t fear to ask questions yourself
there will always be some people and developers thinking like you
talk to them and team up with them
define clear goals and be prepared to be a strong leader with excellent communication skills
creating a successful open source project is not something done over night it s a long term process
to become successful you have to establish an organization and you must be prepared to let it go it s own way with or without your original ideas
think about it and go for it
exactly i thought that i finished my project until compiling isn t accepted on ubuntu because of

once upon a time i modified the sql 2000 maintenance plan system to use sql litespeed and to support differential backups
this required i think modifying a few system procedures and tables in msdb
doing this made me paranoid as any subsequent patch or service pack provided by microsoft would either break my code me in big trouble or my code would break their service pack me dead meat
to cope with this i kept meticulous records of what i did and maintained a thoroughly tested rollback script so that when not if the sps were released i could fist roll the servers back to their prior state patch them and then re apply my changes adjusting my code if and as necessary
i had complete control over the systems affected and never had any serious problems with the setup
if you re careful and cautious enough and you plan ahead you can get away with stunts like this
but
maintenance plans were a cute side light and fairly simple to hack whereas security is a jar of nitroglycerine sitting in a pool of radioactive waste
it could be done but i really wouldn t want to mess with it
the following code will read the ipod library song from its url and copy it to disk for use
note this code wont work with m4as because the urls from ipod library for m4as dont contains headers for that you will need to use avassetexporter to write the header and music data to disk
please note the 1st example contains the ideographic space rather than a regular space
it is the ideographic space that is the problem
here is the code that allows non ascii characters to be used as you can see it disallows funky non visible characters
why
it is probably a safety measure
what others are disallowed
an character that is whitespace or a control character
according to the respective character predicate methods
see the javadocs for a precise specification you should also note that this is a deviation from the uri specification
the uri specification says that non ascii characters are only allowed if you convert the ucs character code to utf 8 and percent encode the utf 8 bytes as required by the spec
my understanding is that the method will take care of that if you have a deviant java net uri object
you need to do use pessimistic locking which can be achieved by on the query and use lockmode upgrade
see query setlockmode however this will certainly kill scalability and performance if you are doing a lot of access on this table
you are better either using a sequence or another strategy is to create a service to allocate numbers e g an ssb which grabs 100 numbers at a time updates the database and hands them out
that saves you 198 database accesses
update you will also have to modify your table design slightly
it is better to have a single row with a known id and to store the number you are incrementing in another column
then you should update the row rather than deleting the old row and adding a new one
otherwise the row locking strategy won t work
update2 op found that the following worked
i recommend using streams for this task to make work as expected you will probably have to define an method for your point class
when you are saving dates to a mongo database you can simply save a javascript date object regardless of timezone
using the date type as in case 2 then you would use moment to display the date in whatever timezone you require

i want to add a class to an anchor tag using jquery
the anchor tag is inside a list item with the class nav 1
i tried the following with no luck
anyone know what i am doing wrong
as far as i can see there in no error for this in the script tab on firebug
there is no class of pink being added
the js file is in the head so maybe this is problem
i will test and post my results
the page can be found here i added the jquery code the the script js file its the last load external js file in the head and i added the following code just before the closing body tag still no luck with the class being added
i believe it might be the way jquery is included in the software
it uses prototype but the framework i m using integrates jquery and adds noconflict feature i think

it looks like this is not well documented
if anybody knows of a good place for documentation please let me know

i m a newb with python and xml parsing so i ve spent a good amount of time over 20 hours rummaging through forums to find how to achieve what i m after

they didn t work when i tried

the prints are looking good but now i just can t get those changes to take form
before i revert back to python 2 7 on which most of the walkthroughs tutorials examples i ve seen are based i would greatly appreciate any help
to my knowledge the 3ds format is very well defined
the only way to reduce space is to either store less information or to compress it
you could compress it with something such as lz compression
there are lots of free lz decompressors around

the system io docs contains a mysterious undocumented function fixio
its source only adds to the mystery this appears to do the moral equivalent of dereferencing null reading from an empty mvar
indeed trying it results in an error thread blocked indefinitely in an mvar operation searching turns up nothing save a 15 year old message from simon peyton jones himself in which he provides the above source and hopes that it would make the meaning clear and yet here i am
can someone please shed some light on this
what does fixio do and when should i use it
take a look at sharekit it s pretty self explanatory with documentation on the website and it offers more than twitter if you want it
so i made this code
basically takes in the number then if negative converts it to positive calculates its binary and then its one complement and then adds 1
when i enter the value as 4 it correctly displays its binary value
however it shows the its 2 compliment as 111111010 this is with carry
why is this happening
the 2 s compliment form of 4 should be different
also is there any other method of converting a negative number to its 2 s compliment form
the answer is a comma sign
in section 4 2 2 of rfc 2109 there s this specification of header with the following statement informally the set cookie response header comprises the token set cookie followed by a comma separated list of one or more cookies
formally meaning of in the above notation is defined in rfc 733 in section a
notational conventions point 5 a construct is defined similar to as follows indicating at least and at most elements each separated by one or more commas
yes rfc 2109 was obsoleted by rfc 2965 which in turn was obsoleted by rfc 6265
no it doesn t change anything in this context as most existing http servers and clients support rfc 2109 rfc 6265 does not forbid folding
take a look at xpath you can basically do anything you need with xml on android using that
so something like that should give you a nodeset of the nodes
hope that helps

the global asax file also known as the asp net application file is an optional file that contains code for responding to application level and session level events raised by asp net or by http modules
the global asax file resides in the root directory of an asp net application
at run time global asax is parsed and compiled into a dynamically generated net framework class derived from the httpapplication base class
asp net is configured so that any direct url request for the global asax file is automatically rejected
external users cannot download or view the code in it
the global asax file is optional
you create it only if you want to handle application or session events

i guess first query is using predicate and second query is using seek predicate
seek predicate is the operation that describes the b tree portion of the seek
predicate is the operation that describes the additional filter using non key columns
based on the description it is very clear that seek predicate is better than predicate as it searches indexes whereas in predicate the search is on non key columns which implies that the search is on the data in page files itself

the formula for calculating body mass index is weight 703 height
create a web page that contains three text boxes weight in pounds height in inches and one that will contain the bmi result
create a script with a function named calcbmi that performs the calculation using the values in the weight and height text boxes and assign the result of the bmi text box
convert the result to an integer by using the parseint function
reference the text boxex from within the function by using the document object form name and name and value attributes of each text box don t use function arguments
perform the calculation by calling the function from onclick event in a button element
this what i could come up with
it s certainly usable
for simple concepts it is adequate
i find that i m often trying to get a user to input something he doesn t understand
at times it s been data i don t understand
then i feel it s really important to get a good understanding of exactly what your data represents and then rather than ask for a table of numbers find a way to inform your user of what he s entering at the same time as he s entering it
for instance in the very simple example you give pretend it s complicated you could actually display a picture of a box on the screen as well as the data
as you input the data the box may shift a little or visibly resize itself
you could then further this by allowing them to drag the edges of the box and have the drag update the fields
although this is too simple an example to warrant that kind of effort i ve had a lot of success for instance setting up a circuit where you must contain a ds0 in a group of ds0s inside a ds1 or t1 which is in a bundle of t1s in an oc 3 which is on one of 3 channels on a fiber loop
it was actually much more complicated than that and took 10 engineers 2 days to document correctly once they figured out what i was asking
at one point we had 4 white boards full of permutations then we refactored them down to a single very crowded piece of paper
once i could understand that i made a great ui for it
also that paper became a marketing document itself they had never described what their box actually does before and that s exactly what their marketing manager said when he looked at the paper
so the shorter take away version for anything that isn t obvious try to fully analyze and comprehend the business problem behind the data you are presenting to requesting from the customer
when you grok it figure out exactly what caused the break through and turn it into a gui
for example if i have this file and i want to add text 192 168 25 50 in this file after each localhost pattern search
i don t want to create a new line i don t want to insert on each end of line but just after a pattern i don t want to use awk i need to know if sed command can do this indeed my result must look like that lot of sed issue exist but all have a specific context which can t help my simple and basics issue
i already can insert text after a pattern in a same file but never in a same line
can you explain me how to insert with sed command in a same line that the pattern used by sed command itself

the problem is here since taxrate is an integer and 100 is an integer it performs integer division with the result being integer 0
it then converts this result to double and multiplies it by useragi
to fix it you just need to force it to do a floating divide as follows since 100 0 is a double constant it will convert taxrate to double before performing the division

i am using local iis 6 0 smtp service to send emails from asp net application
i am having the following issues emails are being delayed from 1 hour to 24 hours and our traffic is only increasing no ui to quickly see what is going on
how many emails sent
bad emails queue etc
have to install iis 6 0 just to run smtp service
microsoft didn t include it in iis 7 0 so not sure if they will be supporting it in the future
seems to send emails in single thread not sure about this one
i could use one of the cloud services like amazon simple email but it would cost me hundreds of dollars a month
i would like to keep it local since our hosting provider has plenty of bandwidth
what are the alternatives to iis 6 0 smtp service

all i m having trouble getting behavior that i want from catiledlayer
is there a way that i can trigger the tiles to redraw without having the side effect that their areas are cleared to white first
i ve already subclassed catiledlayer to set fadeduration to return 0
to be more specific here are the details of what i m seeing and what i m trying to achieve i have a uiscrollview with a big content size 12000x800
its content view is a uiview backed by a catiledlayer
the uiview is rendered with a lot of custom drawn lines everything works fine but the contents of the uiview sometimes change
when that happens i d like to redraw the tiles as seamlessly as possible
when i use setneedsdisplay on the view the tiles redraw but they are first cleared to white and there s a fraction of a second delay before the new content is drawn
i ve already subclassed catiledlayer so that fadeduration is set to 0
the behavior that i want seems like it should be possible when you zoom in on the scrollview and the content gets redrawn at a higher resolution there s no blanking before the redraw
the new content is drawn right on top of the old one
that s what i m looking for
thanks
i appreciate your ideas
update just to follow up i realized that the tiles weren t being cleared to white before the redraw they re being taken out entirely
the white that i was seeing is the color of the view that s beneath my catiledlayer backed view
as a quick hack fix i put a uiimageview beneath the uiscrollview and before triggering a redraw of the catiledlayer backed view i render its visible section into the uiimageview and let it show
this smooths out the redraw significantly
if anyone has a better solution like keeping the redraw targeted tiles from going away before being redrawn in the first place i d still love to hear it

resulting in a spin lock
that condition normally is called a tight loop
there were two ways of solving the problem set the socket to blocking or poll for available data on the socket using poll or select
i chose the former as it was simpler
are you sure that other code parts do not already use or and expect the socket to be in non blocking mode
otherwise then yes the switch to the blocking mode is the simplest solution
best backward compatible solution would have been before calling to use to wait for the socket to become readable
that way ensures that other parts of the code would work precisely as before
but i am wondering why any one would create a non blocking socket and then poll on it separately
doesn t a blocking socket do the same
for the case of no major difference is known to me
what are the uses cases where one would use a non blocking socket and poll combination
are there any advantages to it in general cases
could be a simple coding mistake
or somebody might have thought that recv ing in tight loop would somehow increase the performance

the error says that your file identifier may not be valid
did you check
you get a file identifier fid in your function som_read_data by calling where filename is the name of your file if it s in the current directory or the file name including path name otherwise
to debug you may want to call and check whether message is empty
if it s not there has been an error opening the file and consequently fid is not a valid file identifier
edit you may want to look at what message says
my bet is that it is something like file not found either because the file is not on the path or because you miss the extension
edit2 look through som_read_data to find which function is returning fid before it is used in line 169
if the line says then you should pass a filename to som_read_data i e call

edit if buttons handlers do work perhaps it s problem with databinging are you sure you are calling databind on myrepeater or any of it s parent control
if you are calling databind manually does it depend on page ispostback on your page
itemdatabound will fire only during databinding
if you do a databind on postback it should fire
however databind doesn t happen automatically on postback
instead repeater will rebuild from viewstate if there is no dependency on data you should consider using the itemcreated event instead
that will fire when building the repeater no matter whether that is during databind or from viewstate
scenario i have an expandable listview where in each childview i have switch button
when there is a change in the switch state a bacground job is done in the background using thread
current implementation i have my main fragment class and adapter which extends baseexpandable adapter
in the adapter there is a listener to the switch which call to a method in the fragment class which executes the background operation
one of the parametres that are trasnffered is the relevant object from the dataset and according to the result from the background job the object dataset is changed
using set method
issue there are two main issues 1 the switch state is not saved meaning after re expanding the group it returns to the old state
2 when i use adapter notifydatasetchanged the ui is getting stack for approx 5 seconds and skipped frames message appear in logcat
what i am looking for is a good design implementation example for the above scenarion where threads are involved
desired result 1 switch button is checked 2 background operation is done 3 childview is updated with the new values
thank you all in advanced for your assistance below is part of the expandable code it includes only the relevant parts ms_g_frag is an instance of the class which extends the fragment class the method set_s_state creates a new thread and executes a bacground job
one of the paramets that are places in the set_s_state method is the dateset object of the child view that is being updated according to the background job response
if any further information is required please let me know i hope that helps

i have a simplemappingexceptionresolver to redirect every unhandled exception
as soon as i implemented spring security i realized that i need to exclude the accessdeniedexception now i m implementing spring web flow
swf is wrapping those essential accessdeniedexceptions in flowexecutionexception
this combination breaks spring security as those wrapped exceptions are now caught by the simplemappingexceptionresolver
i could exclude also the flowexecutionexception but this is not what i want
how do i properly solve this problem
my next thaught would be implementing a handlerexceptionresolver which delegates only if the unwrapped exception is not a accessdeniedexception
but i m wondering if there doesn t exist something ready to use for the combination swf security and a handlerexceptionresolver
if you re building a large scale crawler you almost certainly want to be using something like an amqp message queue most probably rabbitmq
rabbitmq and many other similar mqs will do upwards of 100 000 transactions per second with a pretty normal installation
i use it in my own spider crawler setup and it works like a charm
certainly a whole lot easier than building something similar from scratch
for a site like that i guess will need to choose several tools to do the job
for the web you could use any framework so rails would be ok to deal with videos you ll need something like ffmpeg or transconding to convert the videos
for streaming if you can use html5 check this question otherwise you ll need a player whith flash fallback
remember that the heavy part in terms of storage and cpu is video compressing conversion

edit to clarify i am asking for advice on both unit testing and user interface testing
currently i don t use tdd
while i am developing an application i am constantly testing what i am working on
testing iteration could be anything from minor function changes to entire models
i try not to code too much before i test
i like instant feedback
of course with experience i can see potential problems or bugs occurring as i m coding
but after an application is complete i will usually go through the entire app on the frontend and ensure all functions are working as expected
this means literally everything
every add edit delete sort filter even broken links and such
this can take a lot of time sometimes but it does ensure my work hardly ever contains bugs after deployment
however i m looking for a more standard solution
what do experienced developers do
assume for a moment i am a single developer and so do not have a testing department etc do you hire beta testers no good if app is sensitive to public use
is it viable to build a series of general unit tests which can for example test all sorting filter functions
one for testing all add edit delete functions
love to hear your feedback
will be changing the way i develop based on suggestions

an example web config is below if this doesn t work try adding the following to the web config
it will output a detailed log that might allow you to further debug the issue if you post the detailed log of the error from this dump you may get better responses

where is your dialog from
there is a syntax error in your code
if all three dictionaries are stored as a list under the compressed files key you should write it as
simplistically you you want a count of fetchedobjects
so the problem that you re going to have with adding an additional cell is that every time the table ask for the count of sections and rows you re going to have add 1 to the count so the table knows to add the extra row
bjarne mogstad is correct
it s quicker and cleaner to put the add element in a header or footer for the table itself
that way the table directly and cleanly represents the data structure without having to constantly adjust for the phantom row

on my pages onload function i m disabling all controls on the page in the following manner i need one button on the page enabled btnreactivate above
the problem i m having is that anytime i click the button and step into the page_load event page ispostback is always false and the onclick event in the code behind also doesn t fire
the button is created and the event handler as so it s might be also worth mentioning that i ve tried disabling the forms elements in a few different ways including just looping through in input controls rather than all elements
you re modifying var inside of the function call
parameters to a function can be evaluated in any order
in this particular example is being evaluated before but there s no guarantee the behavior will be the same if you use a different compiler
because you re attempting to read and modify a variable in the same expression without a sequence point to separate them you re invoking undefined behavior

i know there are some questions to this effect already on stackoverflow but they tend to be pretty outdated and don t adequately address how migrations are supposed to work in the following scenario which should be fairly common you have some kind of application implemented in rails
you have some kind of admin application for your data and it is a separate application implemented in rails
both applications operate on the same database and models
my question is what is the best way to factor our models such that both of these applications don t have to duplicate model code
we are concerned with the following for the shared models where should database migrations live
what if each individual application wishes to add additional models on top of shared models
where do these migrations live
what is the best way to move existing migrations into the proposed shared migration scheme
thanks

i m trying to update an older ios4 5 era app to ios7 and am getting some compile linker issues i can t figure out
i m not sure the solution to the small subset of the compile errors pasted below
these issues appear to be from my usage of scannerkit
i was on version 4 2 1 and tried to update to the latest 4 3 0 but the issues remain
i defined have libscannerkit a in my link binary with libraries build phase
i m trying to just update the app and make this newest release ios7 only
this project is old and it was original created in the early versions of xcode 4 so i dont know if there is some kind of vestigial config file issues or something
or is this something where scannerkit is built against i386 and i m not including that arch in my build or something
if anyone is interested here is a full gist of the compile errors

i ve been doing some of the leetcode problems and i notice that the c solutions are a couple of times faster than the exact same thing in c
for example updated with a couple of simpler examples given a sorted array and a target value return the index if the target is found
if not return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order
you may assume no duplicates in the array
link to question on leetcode my solution in c runs in 3ms my other c solution exactly the same but as a member function of the solution class runs in 13ms even simpler example reverse the digits of an integer
return 0 if the result will overflow
link to question on leetcode the c version runs in 6ms and the c version is exactly the same but as a member function of the solution class and runs for 19ms i see how there would be considerable overhead from using vector of vector as a 2d array in the original example if the leetcode testing system doesn t compile the code with optimisation enabled
but the simpler examples above shouldn t suffer that issue because the data structures are pretty raw especially in the second case where all you have is long or integer arithmetics
that s still slower by a factor of three
i m starting to think that there might be something odd happening with the way leetcode do the benchmarking in general because even in the c version of the integer reversing problem you get a huge bump in running time from just replacing the line if rev 1u 1 rev lt
1 lt
lt
31 with if rev int_max rev lt
int_min now i suppose having to might have something to do with that but it seems a bit extreme that this simple change bumps the execution time from just 6ms to 19ms
john la rooy s answer is great but i just wanted to point out how simple the base58 algorithm is because i think it s neat

try something like that
say your integers have a range in min_int max_int
then given an integer n from this range the function attributes a unique positive integer in the range which is often called a rank
denote
then to find a unique id of two concatenated integers n and m you can use the common access style also used for two dimensional arrays that is you simply offset the second integer by the largest possible value and count on
practically of course you have to be careful in order to avoid overflows that is you should use some suited data types
here is an example say your integers come from the range thus
then for two integers and out of this range can be used as id

i suppose my my solution will be useful for you
it would be much easier to just swap the first and last values of the array passed in to the function and return that instead of creating a new array
something like the following will work and it doesn t create a new variable to facilitate swapping
the easiest way to do this would be to use an intermediate subject in place of the merge calls
the subject class will stop passing onnext and further onerror and oncompleted events from any of the observables it is subscribed to if it receives any onerror or oncompleted
the main difference between this approach and your sample is that it subscribes to all the events when the subject is created rather than when you subscribe to the merged observable
since all of the observables in your example are hot the difference should not be noticeable

the reason this is complicated for me is that each column of the table is loaded from a separate mysql table and each mysql table will have varying number of records
initially i thought i could start generating the html table from top left to bottom right column by column cell by cell but this won t work because each mysql table will have different length of records which generate malformed html tables
do you have any suggestions
my idea so far get a list of all tables in mysql which determine the number of columns get the count from the table with most records create a table with the parameters of tables as columns max as rows update each cell with the corresponding record but not quite sure how as requested some code this is wrong not just because it generates a malformed table but also because it transposed columns to rows

the effect of repeating an x value in trapz is the same as splitting the interval of integration at that value and applying trapz separately to each part both results are the same
and indeed the best way to integrate a piecewise function like yours is to split the interval of integration at the discontinuity because then you are integrating two continuous functions
your approach is correct
theory stuff in some sense your hack isn t necessary
the trapezoidal rule converges to the correct value of the integral for any riemann integrable function which covers all piecewise continuous functions and more
that a textbook presents its proof for continuous functions only is the choice of the textbook s author wishing to have a simpler proof
a more general theorem could be proved instead
that is for any function arising in practice the output of the trapezoidal rule will be close to its integral provided that the x values form a sufficiently fine partition of the interval of integration
for example uniformly spaced points will always work if you take sufficiently many
however in practice one is concerned about the speed of convergence which is noticeably worse when the function has a discontinuity
from this practical point of view including each point of discontinuity twice with y values being the left and right limits is a significant boost for the accuracy of trapezoidal rule

sounds like a state machine type situation to me where steps are your state objects and where each state may have multiple exit transitions based on conditions such as options currently on
the state will then stand in for the c in mvc
a discussion of the pattern can be found here with a focus on game programming with other examples available
a state pattern will essentially will allow you you create a graph and more importantly allow each edge of the graph to be assigned behavior with will cause the edge to be followed
so in your case the graph could be defined in this made up scheme i just came up with as now your code is nicely objectified but still pretty flexible
when it comes to the behavior you need to run based on condition
now if use this state object as the controller in your mvc scheme it actually all fits together pretty nice
your state machine s current state can create the new views on enter based on some model data
speaking about that model data its not a great idea to hard code that into the state machine infrastructure as it makes everything pretty clunky pretty fast
instead think of using a blackboard ing or message boarding type interface
this idea says that every state should have an interface to write a message to an object
this can be done using delegates in c passing an object to every state when its created or any other pattern that will give all states in the machine access to this global resource
the idea of the board is that a states may post data to it for example the results of some computation or the value of some user input
then later another state running might choose to read a message for a useful value
here is one solution

one approach might be to not use just a simple black rectangle
instead use a path composed of two rectangles
the first rectangle will cover the whole area and the second would just cover the control to be available
this creates a large rectangle with a hole in it where your target control can show through and accept input
the down side is working out the rectangle geometry to add to create the hole but that s fairly straight forward

in the listener function make a urlrequest object using data from the xml and then use navigatetourl to go to that url

so when i am using the winforms gui the file is found but when i am using the mvc website the project can t find it
to answer the reason why you are observing the difference is called the current working directory
by default when vs net launches windows apps or consoles the working directory is to the relevant bin directory
all relative file operations such as will concatenate to an absolute file path as per below
asp net s working directory would not correlate to the root of your web application
where should i place the file in the mvc proejct
as suggested by dariogriffo it should be placed in the directory
i have a solution which has two presentation layers
one is using asp net mvc the other winforms
both projects depend on a third projecs which does some business logic and is a class library
so now you are in a little bit of a pickle over here with your current implementation and the way the current working directory is implemented
without delving into too much detail i suggest that the code figures out how to load the file indirectly such as passing in an interface with a contract such as the following
with the above you can change your business logic to the following the benefit of the above abstraction is that you may then easily substitute the file finding logic as per the other suggestions easily and maybe migrate your dictionary to be hosted in a database somewhere

i m trying to run some tests with conversions and castings of floats to other types and i want to set my float variable to different values of nan
a bit wise example of a ieee floating point standard single precision 32 bit nan would be s111 1111 1axx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx where s is the sign most often ignored in applications a determines the type of nan and x is an extra payload most often ignored in applications
if a 1 it is a quiet nan
if a is zero and the payload is nonzero then it is a signaling nan basically i want to find a way to set the payload or xxxx s of the representation
is there any way to do this in c
ok here is the problem i and many people here i believe doesn t have a clue what s a point of this query what the goal you want to achieve with this
to get desired result you can do something like this
but this query doesn t have a much sense you ll get desired result but i don t know what you can do else with it
here is the fiddle for that to see what s happend there
but if you change a little your table site_gender and add her a column let s call it parent than you will have query like this here is sql fiddle to see how that s look like and work
point of having parent column is that you can choose which 2 column you want to connect when you have larger table so parent column will store id of column with that column should be connected

i m aware of the fact that the filereader object is not available in safari 5 0 5

referenceerror can t find variable filereader so obviously that s not the best way to deal with it then
any idea why this doesn t work
so i m working on something that checks the cpu usage under a certain percentage so that it doesn t bog down the system
i have this code my original thought was to use this do while loop to keep checking the cpu usage until it went over 50 then stop the loop
but for some reason even if the cpuusage nextvalue is over 50 it still doesn t exit the loop
i m guessing it is some problem with this value
any suggestions
how do i check if all post data are not empty
below is my code
this allows to insert data even when there are blank fields
i even tried the below
did not work
what might be the issue
i also have been stumbling over this for a while
here is a design pattern i have come up with that i have not seen elsewhere
the class is not final subclassing should be safe
all of the constructors must be private
public accessors should be final
private mutators in the base class should be final
public mutators in the mutable class should be final
use factory methods to construct immutable and mutable objects
this is like the subclass mutable pattern but since the mutable class is an inner class it has access to private fields and methods in the base class so nothing needs to be protected which could possibly be overridden
the base class is just like a standard mutable class except the constructors and mutators are private
the mutable subclass is a thin layer every method is super that exposes the mutators
to create an immutable instance bob test1 bob immutable 99
to create a mutable instance bob mutable test2 bob mutable

just thought i d post back as say the issues i was having have been solved by disabling buttons that access core data until the document is ready this way you ll never try to open the document at the same time as another process
and as for core data access in a life cycle handler like viewdidload i implemented a system where by if the document is opening state kept manually with a variable it delays the call by looping until the document is open in essence queuing the calls
don t forget to use performselector withobject afterdelay in the call within to loop otherwise you ll get an application crash
thanks for your suggestions john

there are a few odd things here
first when you have use strict active you will get a warning if you use a variable without declaring it or referencing it by fully qualified name
what you have actually done is to declare a local cfg with in xyzzy pl and then to reference a different package global variable main cfg implicitly declared by using its fully qualified name
to make the reference link to the same cfg that you declared you should declare it to make it package global
then you can either reference it as in both places or just from xyzzy pl or else you can declare it in plugh pm as well so that you can use the bare cfg in both places
the odd thing is that you do have two references to that variable so you shouldn t get the warning
i think what has happened here is that the implicit declarations in two separate files are assumed to be separate variables
xyzzy pl plugh pm

when building web services i like to generate a unique request id for each request that comes in
this way i can include this id in log messages i generate which allows my to debug monitor my service better in production
when using retrofit i want to be able to include this id in log messages generated by the library
for example when setting restadapter loglevel basic on a restadapter a log message with the following format is generated i want to be able to include my generated request id like the following is there a recipe that ll allow me to do this with retrofit and or okhttp
while i m still struggling to find a solution for this question i have another one which maybe is easier
the following is the insert function of okasaki red black tree implementation
what i want to do is to keep the data unsorted as i insert into the tree
so the data always go to the leftmost bottom most leaf everytime i insert
there is no need to compare for x lt
y x y or x y
it seems pretty straightforward at first by just removing these guards and only do ins s t color a y b balance color ins a y b
the behaviour seems to be that the tree is kept balanced but the coloring becomes a bit messed up
and eventually that affects future inserts
any idea how this can be achieved
i think this could possibility my first step to my previous question
i just started playing with haskell so i am not getting it right straightforward
thanks a lot

this can be integrated in your build process so that the distributed code does not contain any todo markers but these are still in svn and you can remove them afterwards when you made the new product compatibe
or whatever scripting language you prefer
error occurs in development mode as cache is set to false so after setting the cache to true atleast in dev mode error will not occur but query caching will take place so you need to work upon it also in mine it was a metal request which was not loading the classes after the next action is called
in case of production query caching takes place while error doesn t appear in this mode but results are not as expected as changes in database were not reflected
so in both the cases the solution which worked or me is bypass query caching
update the other guys are correct to replace all references you would change the resources name and corresponding controller in routes rb
my answer is only good to set a specific route
yup you would do this in your routes rb using the as option to specify example source
it is possible that you have these warnings turned off
in your target build settings look for implicit integer to pointer conversions under apple llvm 7 0 warnings all languages
in case it is set to no you will not get warnings for these kinds of conversions
i know there are other and more preferred methods but i m trying to give a div img a bounce effect using jquery
i m trying to loop any help would be awesome
thanks
you might try rewriting the query to use analytic functions rather than a correlated subquery you might want to remove the max_up_date column in the outside select
as some have noticed this query is subtly different from the original because it is taking the max of up_date over all dates
the original query has the condition however by transitivity this means that so the only difference is when the max of the update date is less than date1 in the original query
however these rows would be filtered out by the comparison to up_date
although this query is phrased slightly differently i think it does the same thing
i must admit to not being 100 positive since this is a subtle situation on data that i m not familiar with
based on the comment stating that error nodes will have only error children one simplification will be to concentrate on leaf nodes if any inner node is an error node then there must be at least one leaf node which is an error as well
if the number of leafs exceeds n as well then you have to choose which leafs to test
you want to maximize the total number of nodes covered by these leafs
i e
find a set of n leafs which maximizes the number of ancestors these have
a greedy strategy would compute the number of ancestors for every leaf then choose one with maxial number of ancestors and recompute ancestor counts for all the others
a brute force strategy would try all combinations of choosing n leafs
a model which resembles linear programming might have one binary i e
0 1 variable per leaf
0 would mean choosing it while 1 would mean not choosing it so you d have an equation stating that the sum over all these leafs is equal to the number of leafs minus n
the objective function would be a sum with one summand per inner node
the term for each of them would be the product of the variables for the leafs descendent from it
so the value for each inner node would be 1 if all leafs are 1 but 0 if there is at least one leaf which is 0
minimize the sum of these and you have maximized the number of covered inner nodes
the objective is obviously highly non linear so it s not linear programming nor even binary integer programming
if the number n is very large or very small compared to the number of leafs you might approximate an optimal solutiono by assuming some independence
if you can select almost all leafs you can look for those leafs which have fewest inner nodes that lead to no other leaf
perhaps removing the dropped portion from the tree after every such step
if you can select almost no leafs the greedy strategy above would let you select those which maximal number of ancestors
in both these cases you might assume that your individual choices don t interact with one another too much justifying the greedy approach
you need to extend the org eclipse jdt core compilationparticipant extension point and override the reconcile method
this will get your code called whenever a reconcile operation occurs
it will provide you an ast possibly with bindings already resolved
with this you are expected to add extra markers and annotations to the file through the reconcilecontext instance passed in to the method
presumably your plugin is implemented so that instance variables are highlighted using markers and if so this would fit in nicely with your implementation
why this don t work
i can t do this
i can t give a dimension to an array through a function
i tried to find on internet how this works but i dint find anything so i prefer to post it here for a direct answer
thanks
and sorry for my english
i have an activity with 3 fragments a b c
fragment a consists of a viewpager with 2 listfragments
the user can tap on an item in any of the listfragments and by doing so goes to fragment b
in fragment a i do and the pageradapter is as follows the first time the activity is shown the viewpager list fragments are displayed correctly
the 2 viewpager fragments load data from a db and i do this only once when the fragments are created
the user can tap on an item and fragment b is displayed
if the user presses back fragment a is shown
however the list fragments are not shown already an instance of them still exists
could it be that the view has been destroyed even though instances exist
what is wrong here
is there a better approach
edit if i use newinstance in the pager adapter i get an illegalstateexception not attached to activity
this is because i start an async task as follows and onshown is when can i start the task so that i can be 100 sure that the fragment is attached to the activity and that the view has been created i need to get listview etc

1 my problem
i run a wordcount program in a 4 nodes spark cluster
the input of the program is local file system file
i know i should distribute the file to all worker nodes in my situation quad102 is master quad103 quad105 are slaves so the file should exist in the same path in these slaves nodes and i m sure i do not make the quad102 as slave according this problem s answer spark how to use sparkcontext textfile for local file system
but in my practice if the master node doesn t have the same file the program can t run too and in fact the 4 nodes all need have this file in the same file otherwise it can t run
i had read through the sparkcontext textfile source code i don t find any problems could someone explain why the master need this file too
in my opinion only slave nodes need this file 2 my program and cluster configuration
1 4 nodes cluster is standalone mode quad102 is master quad103 quad105 are slaves
2 the program is very simple 3 the command i run this program
i m trying to use sti because i want to use single sign in page for a device
i want to assign either teacher_id or student_id to a user but it turned out that all the user has both
how can i fix this problem
below are the models and the migration
if i have understood correctly you actually want to construct a surface from a point set
there is a tutorial just for that
to help a bit the code above shows what you have to provide in order to build the surface
your result is stored in c2t3 and you can generate the implicit surface from a set of points as shown in the example by using a poisson function there are two ways to proceed include the initial points in the pointset generated from your implicit function and define a poisson reconstruction function on that
provide that surfacemeshtraits_3 traits class model that you can the pass onwards
in principle two is difficult and you have to either redefine it from start modify an existing one or derive from a current and implement tip concepts in cgal are abstract classes models are the concrete implementations
once done there you can use to use it
in order to achieve custom reconstruction e g

i have a theme and for a post page i m showing the image value if there is one
i also have a plugin that renders a youtube video and usage is like this
in my template file would it be possible to reference the video value from the front matter of a post and render it with the same plugin that i can use in my content
something like thanks
i want to create a c cross platform windows and macos x application that sends the screen as a video stream to a server
the application is needed in the context of lecture capture
the end result will be a flash based web page that plays back the lecture presenter video and audio slides desktop
i am currently exploring a few options bundle the vlc the video player binary with my app and use its desktop streaming features
use the qt phonon library but it doesn t seem to be powerful enough
send individual screenshots plus a timestamp to the server instead of a video stream
the server then would have to create the video stream
implement it in java and use xuggler bigbluebutton uses it for their desktop sharing feature
i would greatly appreciate your insights comments on how to approach this problem
this looks like the output from an app generated using aws mobile hub

you cannot do this using a google form
however what you can do is write a ui using google apps script which has the same fields as your form
you can customize this ui a lot more where you can show a report on the confirmation screen etc
i suggest you go through the google apps script tutorials and start writing your ui
if you get stuck or need help come back with the issue you re facing
the exception you re seeing in logcat points to a problem in the oncreate method of your activity
the interesting part is this
it s telling you that whatever object you re calling on is null
looking at the body of the method it s only possible on this line
therefore you can tell that the crash is caused by mlocation being null
you re initializing mlocation like this
the documentation tells you it s possible to get a null return value if the provider is disabled
that should answer the why
now you can think about the best way to work around this for your application
can you try another provider
if none of the providers are enabled can you default to a generic location
do you want to show an error message instructing the user to enable location services and provide a way to try again
if you need the index then perhaps you are using the wrong collection type
a queue is not designed to support random access like an array or a
if you need random access then perhaps you should be using a type that implements
after the getelementbyid call codename is either a dom element or null
you can use an alert to see which so should work
does the error happen before it gets that far
i would try adding alerts to see the values as the code runs
or step through this code in a debugger
i m trying to write a predicate that will take a list a number and a variable that will then give the first n elements of the list to the variable
i m able to do this but while trying to make it more flexible so that it will stop when it reaches the end of the list or when n is 0 i started getting a garbage variable returned at the end of my list
here is my code and when i try to use i get
i think it has something to do with how i didn t define result as an empty list but i don t know how to do so while keeping the functionality of the predicate
iterating through the dom using would be very expensive
but since the function your running is on document ready then you will know immediately if you have set up any z index properties 10000
my best suggestion to you is to simply keep track of the elements you are setting a z index on
basically you know know that you probably should never sent a z index 10000
here is what i would do
make some limits keep going until you cover all the layers you need and manager your z indicies through your own custom design standards
this should correct as follows example program
i want to disable future dates and i used the code below but whenever i select future dates it s get selected

instead of creating a drop down menu with share options you should just call share intent once you ve clicked on share button or menu option
that way the list of possible apps would be shown as on the example you ve pasted
here is an example of how could you do it
for qa purposes i need to provide a sample of error records as well the total number of errors records
for background this sample needs to be limited to 1000 records since the query results are stored in an excel recordset object and output to a text file
this sounds very clunky and is but there are reasons for it
i know i can do but i d like a more efficient way since errortable is actually a subquery that finds all the error records and can get pretty computationally expensive
whilst building unit tests for a client server system at work i ran into a problem where my io_service was not releasing after i had shutdown all the active handlers that i was aware of

my question is this is there an easy way to list the currently active handlers in the boost io_service
if not why not
any insight would be appreciated
the decimal number 433 is 0x1b1 and is an int and is usually 32 bits longs
what happens when you cast it to a char which usually have 8 bits is that all but the lowest 8 bits are just thrown away leaving you with 0xb1 which is as a signed two complement 8 bit integer
i have the following json file as input etc
my ultimate goal is to trace this tree recursively wrapping each key object name with tags and the properties at the particleindex level in some kind of structure but i can t figure out how to index into the two values arrays
this is the code that i have been manipulating to learn how each element object or array is accessed this obviously doesn t work because the index of values is outside of the string but when it is on the inside php interprets it as part of the string
is there a way for me to index into each element of the values array and ultimately in a for loop
i m thinking using the true property of json decode might be a better solution
i m sending lots of requests using javascript and in chrome the first request will take around 30ms and the second will take around 300ms

can anyone shed some light on this situation

i m developing a website that also includes an image upload
using html5 apis i have been able to create individual progress bars for every image upload process
as noted in the official documentation ie9 and earlier versions don t support multiple file uploads and html5 apis
what i need is a progress bar for ie9 and lower
i ve read that iframes aren t capable of displaying the progress of file uploads
neither i want to resort to some flash upload plugin
i ve also read that it is possible to add apc support if not present to the server which is configured to report the file s upload progress
so how safe is apc and are there any other possible ways of displaying progress bar in ie9 and lower versions
in rebol 3 you load code using rebol r which is supposed to go in the same directory as the rebol executable
it won t load rebol r from the user s home directory because files in that directory tend to be writeable by programs running with the user s permissions which makes it a nice place to put malware
the place you put the rebol executable is assumed to be more easily securable against user code writing to it
the file user r is reserved to put user specific settings and preferences expressed in a non procedural dialect that we haven t discussed yet
even when it comes back it won t be a way to load code for the same reason that rebol r isn t loaded from the user s home directory
it will only be for preferences
if you want to load user specific code you might want to do so explicitly using code in rebol r but be careful of security issues
the need for user specific code is rare in rebol 3
you might also consider taking advantage of rebol 3 s module system
most library and utility code is better off being defined in modules and you can decide where to put those modules by setting
then your scripts import the actual modules by name without having to know where they are really located
you could also set the default file extension for modules in case reb isn t to your liking
it s rare that you would want to load code for global use since the need for the code is local to the scripts
one such use is to load extensions in rebol r before you lock down the security so that no more extensions can be loaded
this lets you limit extensions to an approved list
any global code can be delay loaded so it doesn t clutter the system for scripts that don t need it
delay loaded code isn t really imported until it is requested by the script
from the codeigniter user guide beyond simplicity a major benefit to using the active record features is that it allows you to create database independent applications since the query syntax is generated by each database adapter
it also allows for safer queries since the values are escaped automatically by the system
the creator of ion_auth may have had a particular reason for escaping the string but if you are using active record codeigniter escapes the queries automatically
but there are queries that look like they might be active record which need to be escaped
here s a list of them again from the codeigniter user guide

so this is my first time using ninject everything worked great until i ran into a problem where some service classes needed adition modalstate argument in constructor
problem was solved by anser on this question answer on previouse question now next problem were that i have about 40 service classes which need to have access to modelstate in constructor therefor i choose to use generics and i really dont know if this is actually legit in any way
or do i have to redo it

there is no easy way to do this
this sounds like a slight design logic error on your part which has lead you to try to do this when there is a better way to do whatever it is you are wanting to do
can you tell us why you want to do this
you say that i know the keys and values of the elements i want to switch which makes me think that what you really want is a sorting function since you can easily access the proper elements anytime you want as they are
if that is the case then i would use sort ksort or one of the many other sorting functions to get the array how you want
you can even use usort to
other than that you can use array_replace if you ever need to swap values or keys
instead of re sending the query just to sort the data why don t you do something like this to sort the data on the screen in the grid instead

i m not sure where you read that registrysearch returns a 1 if a key exists
i ve never heard of that
according to the msdn doco it name the registry value name
if this value is null then the value from the key s unnamed or default value if any is retrieved
note that it is not possible to use the reglocator table to check only for the presence of the key
however you can search for the default value of a key and retrieve its value if it is not empty
it s hard to say without seeing the msi or log but i m guessing you have the property defined as 1 somewhere else in your source using a condition such as also upgrade element table entries should be usable even if your upgradecode changed

when i use pdo i pass an array of bind parameters then i can log the sql statement and the array together
if you try to substitute the parameters into the sql statement the result will not take into account any escaping pdo will perform on your parameters
in your controller assign your tag or directive ex item will represent each json object in the array and you can use
to reference each object property

that is correct redux stores like any other javascript objects do not survive a refresh
during a refresh you are resetting the memory of the browser window
both of your approaches would work however i would suggest the following save to local storage only information that is semi persistent such as authentication token user first name last name ui settings etc
during app start or component load load any auxiliary information such as sales figures message feeds and offers
this information generally changes quickly and it makes little sense to cache it in local storage
for 1
you can utilize the middleware
it let s you save to and retrieve from your browser s local storage during app start
this is just one of many ways to accomplish this
for 2
your approach makes sense
load the required data on componentwillmount asynchronously
furthermore regarding being up to date with data this entirely depends on your application needs
a few ideas to help you get started exploring your problem domain with each request to get offers also send or save a time stamp
have the application decide when a time stamp is too old and request again
implement real time communication for example socket io which pushes the data to the client instead of the client requesting it
request the data at an interval suitable to your application
you could pass along the last time you requested the information and the server could decide if there is new data available or return an empty response in which case you display the existing data
im developing an application and use flashwindowex to flash the update window however it always manages to steal focus from full screen applications like games and such
this is not what i want and is very annoying
is there any way to work out whats causing it to steal focus tried commenting out flashwindowex but it still did or a way to tell it not to steal focus
this happens on all versions of windows including 7 and the game is launched seperatly to the application
if you just want to test for an existence of an element then simply use the element name alternatively use a templated approach in this case the template matching tag2 with the extra condition has higher priority than the other one
this means the second template will only match tag2 elements which don t have tag3 under them
you re right

there was another problem which broke my code and i was looking for the solution where it wasn t

i have a table with supplier details my query so if q 1 i will get mike s details
but what if i want to show also related id details
for example if bill is related to mike how can i show bill s details on page when q 1
i know this is not best practice it s just to demonstrate my problem

1 relativelayout views inside a relativelayout are relative to the position of other children in the relativelayout
2 linearlayout views inside the linearlayout are in a linear pattern either horizontal or vertical
i personally rarely use relativelayout unless it is inside a linearlayout and i need to position a single view in an odd place against the horizontal or vertical aspect of linearlayout
relativelayout can be confusing because if you change the dimensions of one view in it you have to adjust the dimensions of all other views that are relative to that view
not sure about this i ve never faced it before

if you re running a service inside a container then amqp guest guest localhost won t do you any good
localhost refers to the network namespace of the container so of course you get an econnrefused because there s nothing listening there
if you want to connect to a service in another container you need to use the ip address of that container or a hostname that resolves to the ip address of that container
if you are running your containers in a user defined network then docker maintains a dns server that will map container names to addresses
that is if i first create a network and then start a rabbitmq container in that network then other containers started in that network will be able to use the hostname rabbitmq to connect to that container
for containers running in the default network no parameter on the command line you can use the option to achieve a similar though less flexible effect as documented here
the document frequency is the number of documents in the collection that contain a term from introduction to information retrieval so in your words the former option just see if that term occurs

that s a programming error it should fire an assert but not an exception

that s an exceptional situation

we have an asp net file delivery app internal users upload external users download and i m wondering what the best approach is for distributing files so we don t have a single point of failure by only storing the app s files on one server
we distribute the app s load across multiple front end web servers meaning for file storage we can t simply store a file locally on the web server
our current setup has us pointing at a share on a primary database file server
throughout the day we robocopy the contents of the share on the primary server over to the failover
this scneario ensures we have a secondary machine with fairly current data on it but we want to get to the point where we can failover from the primary to the failover and back again without data loss or errors in the front end app
right now it s a fairly manual process
possible solutions include robocopy
simple but it doesn t easily allow you to fail over and back again without multiple jobs running all the time copying data back and forth store the file in a blob in sql server 2005
i think this could be a performance issue especially with large files
use the filestream type in sql server 2008
we mirror our database so this would seem to be promising
anyone have any experience with this
microsoft s distributed file system
seems like overkill from what i ve read since we only have 2 servers to manage

best practice dictates avoiding the suppression operator so go with isset
if you re concerned enough with micro optimization to consider the difference you should know that php still handles suppressed errors even though they re not displayed
any optimization theoretically gained by would likely be lost by the error processing
best practice also dictates specificity in getting input from external sources
i d also recommend choosing _post or _get as alternatives

non msi applications do not have a product code and therefore have keys like hklm uninstall notaguid or hkcu uninstall notaguid

you should use the converttoraw and convertfromraw functions to serialize and deserialize the contents of the editor

you can synthesise it with for iis you don t get request_uri
i ve sent mail from gce instances before
it can be useful to mail logs updates alerts or what ever you want
however to send mail from a gce instance you need a non gce server through which you would relay mail
this is where sendgrid or other providers come in
you can authenticate to google s gmail smtp servers as well if you use a google account
in summary here are your options relay your messages via your own standalone smtp server or some other third party like sendgrid
use imap auth with google accounts so that you could send from google s smtp servers
if you re a google apps for work customer you can use their smtp relay service
just a gce instance alone won t be enough to send your mail

the main thing is to remember that attributes on a certificate request and extensions in a certificate are not the same thing
generally people are trying to add one or more extensions but in that case you need to use the appropriate pkcs 9 attribute to signify this not the oid associated with the extension
say for example you wanted to request a specific keyusage extension from the ca you would have something like the extensionrequest block should then be assumed by the ca to contain the extensions you want
you can do demo

visit azure pricing tab
your best bet is to host webapi on azure or a windows vps
in case of vps you can buy managed windows vps costly or an un managed windows vps
a quick google search can give you the cost estimates for same
in case of azure websites everything is managed by ms amp
you just need to deploy your code to azure
if you can t afford azure go with php for rest services
in general hosting on linux is much cheaper than windows
apart from hosting you may need to invest in sql server you can also use mysql on windows
vs 2013 community is now free and hence you have saved some cost for ide

if i understand correctly you have multiple ajax calls and would like to do something after they ve all finished
this has nothing to do with the jquery document ready which is related to the loading of the dom
it s your application s logic
a bare bones solution a bit ad hoc would be as follows if you re using calls they all have the done fail always callbacks you can use to notify some other function that they re done if you re not using jquery ajax then find the relevant hook callback and adjust the code example below accordingly
then you could do something after 3 ajax calls have finished

i m having a problem with passing the entity manager between two layers of controllers
the system i m building has the following structure 2 bundles core bundle let s call it backend controller this is the bundle that contains all the models entities and business rules logic
api bundle call it frontend controller is responsible for checking the permissions of passed in api keys and communicating with the core bundle to get the info
here s an example with the user controllers and entities usercontroller php in apibundle usercontroller php in corebundle please tell me if i m doing this right
it seems strange to pass the entity manager between the controllers every time
maybe there s a better way of doing that
does the idea between the separation of the bundles make sense
thank you every idea is greatly appreciated

i have an option group or frame and inside i have 4 buttons option buttons
they are called opt_mtto opt_elec opt_qlty opt_complete so i was selecting the property of each button to enable false so when my form load they will be disabled
but i didn t to be coding each button to enable each of the buttons i though
why wouldn t be better to say to the frame to be disable so all inside would be disable
so instead of going for each button i return to my properties and enabled them again but i disable my frame so this made the same way but only with 1 click
but i got a problem when i click a button i want my frame get enabled so i code this enabled all my buttons but i only want 1 button disable in this case so my code is and this get me an error 2101 the setting you entered isn t valid for this property
so i made this the other way i enabled my frame and then call the option button to be disable and it works
i only want to know why i can t do this the first way i mention
i repeat is when form_load the property are already set to the frame as false no code is set manually in properties when click button enable frame just after of enable the frame disable one of the buttons inside
error

i have a lot more experience in c than go
i m trying to understand how the composite design pattern is expressed idiomatically in go in particular with reference to attributes

an interface lets me define which methods to implement but it doesn t let me provide a default implementation
i have to reimplement the method in every struct that implements the interface and replicate all of the attributes in each struct
i can t keep common attributes in an interface because interfaces don t have data elements

i am struggling to think through the logic of defining geographic region which will be the basis of the count
for example in some places there might need to one plot for a whole country and in others like the usa one per city
this is an example of what i am trying to achieve i m fine with the formatting and map plotting it s the data base query i m stuck with and maybe the changing query as the map is refocused e g

it doesn t matter what you change nic to afterwards since that value is not used

i am using spring 3 and tomcat 6 and i am using eclipse 3 6 i ve a big problem with serving images or other things different from controller responses
in fact i can t find a way to have my images in my jsps

what s the correct way
update solution found
the problem was that my servlet config xml missed one declaration now it is using annotations on the controller

when creating an angular directive with replace true then the html in the dom is going to be replaced with your template html
the attributes will then be put on the element that is going to replace your element
e g
will become something similar to when my template of the mydirective directive looks like now the question is how can i achieve that the name attribute is not set on the div but on the inner input element
i could do it manually by be removing the attributes from the parent div element and add them to the input element
but i asked my self whether there would be an automated way to do this with an option for angular directives
to have your packages that you ve either downloaded or personally created visible to mathematica put them in userbasedirectory applications or basedirectory applications if you want them accessible to all users on your system
alternatively version 8 0 4 and likely earlier has a menu option file install which will do it for you
the menu option brings up the following dialog where the option install for this user only name would install it under userbasedirectory and the for all users option would install it under basedirectory
for more information on where mathematica places everything i would read this tutorial and look through directory operations functionality

triggers are usually a bad idea
you ve uncovered yet another reason why triggers are often a mistake
the primary reason is that triggers break your programming into two pieces
the code that is code and is easy to find and maintain and the code that is hidden in the database and is much more difficult to find and maintain
if it s really hard to do you re using the wrong tool

i have configured my asp net website to use windows auth and disabled annon auth and setup some authorization rules
the website is deployed on the intranet and all users have a windows identity
when a user navigates to the website the typical windows security window pops up asking the user for his identity
i want to disable this since the user is already logged in with a domain account
the browser should submit the current identity and iis can use this to auth
any ideas
note i am using ie and the enable integrated windows authentication is checked

the values will be bound as strings

there isn t anything major wrong with your code but in case you receive promise then resolve it first instead of assigning it directly to scope sportevents
with asynchronous calls like you ll receive a promise that yes something will be returned
when operation finishes you can either resolve the promise for data or in case of error reject it
so this service and usage should work just fine with your json format

a page can only contain a single child
if you only want a single frameworkelement displayed in the page then you can do otherwise you will need to create a container that can contain multiple children there are of course many other types of container that you can use

although it might not be ideal it was settled on generating a second pagelist due to the fact that cloning through visualbrush is not an option in uwp
in theory the brushes should not be large and shouldn t take up too much memory
httpclient does not take property or any other for this matter unless explicitly instructed to do so as of version 4 5 httpclient disables sslv3 protocol version by default one can however explicitly set up supported ssl protocol versions using a custom ssl connection factory

one thing that speed up a lot
scripts is to declare your matrices prior to entering a loop
for example for your smd aet recharge etc matrix you should use something like where nrow and ncol is the size of the final matrix if known of course
then do your loop

caching can or should be implemented whenever possible
also caching should be transparent so anyone who uses it shouldn t know it is actualy used
most of the time it s logical to put it inside a data access layer but sometimes it is logical and possible to put it in business layer too

it doesn t matter where the file in which you ve written is
what matters is where you are when you import and call the function
so use the full path when you check whether the file exists
this will allow the check function to work anywhere

that said if you want story1 to be statically accessible from other pages in the site or even other controller actions on the server you could construct a static model with the above you could also do something like this update i am not suggesting the use of a static model here
from reading it is clear that the op does not understand the difference between an object class and an object instance or at least where that difference lies in c
the cshtml error was trying to get to the story title statically which it could not because the property was not static
i believe the answer to this question is not so much mvc101 but rather c 101 or even oop101
i am revising the answer again to show my new example
this example will send q enter at the start of the script every time the user hits the enter key
now when typing the letter b on the keyboard it automatically pauses the script and sends the key like normal
whenever the user types the spacebar the script is automatically activated again to start sending q enter again
it can be manually paused unpaused by using the pause break key on the keyboard and the process can be terminated by pressing the escape key

yes you understand correctly
branch testing is just all branches are executed

the interface set in java lang util has the exact same structure as collection of the same package
in the inheritance hierarchy abstractset is sub to both set and abstractcollection both of which are sub to collection
the other immediate descendant of set is sortedset and sortedset is extending only set
what i m wondering is what s the gain in set in java lang util why is it there
if i m not missing anything it s not adding anything to the current structure or hierarchy of the api
all would be the same if abstractset didn t implement set but just extended abstractcollection and sortedset directly extended collection
the only thing i can think of is set is there for documentation purposes
shouldn t be for further structuring re structuring the hierarchy that would mean structural modifications of the descendants and doesn t make sense
i m looking for verification or counter arguments if i m missing something here
edit the q is why is set there what is it adding to the structure of the apis
obvious how set is particular among collections mathematically

this is a typical situation where you might want to consider giving your application more structure
there are several libraries out there that help you solve the problem of data flow within your application for example redux nuclearjs alt and many others
all these libraries implement some variant of the flux architecture but you re free to look for other solutions if you don t think flux suits you even though i recommend you look into it
to solve the problem at hand without the need of a global state and application structure you could however decide to store all your data in you main component and have the tab components act as dumb components
in order to achieve this you should define a data structure within your main component in order for it to hold your data have each tab component fire an event whenever some of its content changes have the main component react to these events and use them to store the data coming from the tabs into the data structure
when inserting a tab you would have to do something like and within the tab you would need to call props onformdatachange when it s appropriate passing to it whatever you need to
this is of course just a general example your mileage may vary
take a look a some frameworks libraries though because your problem is something they can easily solve
just a general question here i m doing some self paced learning on mongodb and to get off on the right foot i d like an opinion on how to organize collections for a sample budget application
as with any home budget i have categories such as home auto and i also have subcategories under those categories such as mortgage and car payments
each bill will have a due date minimum amount due a forecast payment forecast payment date actual payment and actual payment date
each bill is due to someone for example home mortgage may be due to bank of america and bank of america may have contact info phone mailing address
making the switch from a table structure to mongo is a bit confusing so i appreciate any opinions on how to approach this

i m writing an mini ftp server in python that exposes an underlying database as if it was ftp
the flow is something like this data_sock is the pasv socket that s up and working confirmed by wireshark
what s actually happening is after the 163 328th byte has been sent over the data_sock the data_sock send line just hangs
i suspect the send buffer is full but it s a mystery to me why the ftp clients wouldn t be reading from the pasv socket
i ve included the popen2 line because i ve managed to reproduce on os x sockets don t close until the popen process is killed
not sure if this is somehow related

you can create your skspritenodes that will collide with a physicsbody categorybitmask whateverbitmask and then in didbegincontact you can check to see if either contact bodya categorybitmask whateverbitmask or contact bodyb categorybitmask whateverbitmask

check your php ini file on it if you have this change it to after that remember to restart apache either using any control panel that appserver offers or using the services windows on the control panel of the system
also be sure that php_openssl dll is on a folder that the system can reach many people use to solve the problem of dll location problems by copying them to c windows or c windows system32
although that shouldn t be necessary
after that execute a file with phpinfo and check that it s enabled
i have read somewhere can t pinpoint it that some installation of that kind of wamps have more that one php ini but only one is really active could it be that you have edited the wrong one
there s only one ng app allowed
there can be many modules it relies on
example
you can override onpause method which runs when user presses home button and your application go in background and ondestroy which called back when your application is been killed
check this

okay so i have a yui datatable
most of it is exactly as the how to guide says to construct it
i have an event that governs changing the rows per page
it s linked to the rows per page drop down element and it saves the value of that drop down as a cookie when the drop down is changed
the problem is that yui pg0 1 rpp24 the id of the drop down changes whenever i make updates to my data table
i would like to extend this so that when the page loads it will dynamically insert the id of that drop down into this event listener so that i don t have to keep editing it after future updates
i ve managed to construct that following that will capture the id and i can alert it after the table loads but so far including the result of this function in the above addlistener code isn t working
any suggestions you ve got would be awesome

you can think of an index just as a order list with fast lookup
if you have a compound index with fields a b c d the list will be ordered on a then for rows with the same a for b than c than d
a query optimizer will check your query
if your query asks for a b c d everything is fine
the order of the query should not matter for a good database so you can also write the query where d and c and b and a
if your query ask only for a again everything is fine because all rows with the same a are one after the other
if your query asks only for d the index is of no use
rows with the same d but different a are distributed over the whole list
if your query asks for a b d like your campaign level report then the index is of some use
it can be used to speed up the lookup of a and b but it then needs to iterate over all data because c is missing
you can define more than one index
the drawback is of course that each additional index makes writing slower and needs some space on the harddrive
i had the same problem i could solve it like this using and when you do not have data
given one object you can find its tags like this building on that you want to take that list of tags and find other parent_ids that share them
that will give you a count of how many tags those other parent_ids share
you can if you d like to find the most similar rows first
hope that helps
you should have used instead of
is equivalent to a better way to write this loop would be
dekel s answer is the way to go
additionally if you want to make it a little bit nicer you could hide the change button until the values are actually available
to reach that set the button to be hidden by the loading of the page via css and in your you can then call for displaying the button

i just had to use the same instance for the whole app
here s how i solved the issue i ve removed admediator and instantiated the banners manually using c
so i ve created a single instance of adview and adrequest public static in the class app which i initialize in the event application_launching
then in every page where i needed a banner in the event onnavigatedto i set the adview of app class as a children of the page grid contentgrid and launch the loadad method on the adrequest instance of the app class
then in the event onnavigatedfrom i remove the adview from the children of the grid
done
no more memory leak

yes you ll need two certificates one for ssl and one for signing
these should be on the hosting server in you certificate store

you don t have to go to a ca for this one

i am designing a all to all android program including 5 nodes each node acts as both server and client each node will connect to the other 4 nodes
each node will listen and accept the other 4 nodes connections
while i have the problem that if the 5 nodes are launched in the order of 1 2 3 4 5 node1 s tcp connection request will not be accepted by node2 since node2 is launched later than 1
in order to solve this issue i ve tried using but it always returns true even when only node1 is launched

i m working on code that is many hundreds of lines long but have boiled my issue down to the following example
my question is why the typescript compiler fails on one case but succeeds when the underlying class is used
the following code compiles just fine if i make one change however altering typeof component to typeof rootcomponent in the constructor of viewmanager the compiler and vs2015 intellisense complains the error is in the argument to the react createfactory method and says error ts2345 build argument of type typeof rootcomponent is not assignable to parameter of type componentclasslt
anygt
statelesscomponentlt
anygt
vs 2015 intellisense gives a bit more information when hovering over the argument to react createfactory namely type typeof rootcomponent provides no match for the signature props
any context
any reactelementlt
anygt
another odd quirk on all this
if i remove or comment out the static childcontexttypes in the rootcomponent then it all compiles fine but when i run it in my working much longer application i get runtime complaints about lack of childcontexttypes
i know this isn t really magic but it seems like black magic to me at the moment and any clarifying insight would be most appreciated
i would like to have text that scrolls smoothly on my c windows form

i ve researched this subject thoroughly including questions and answers on this website
this is my basic code and my objective is to be able to input a string like hello world how are you today and have the program break up this single string into an array of strings like hello world how are you today
but whenever i compile this code i get this output keywords ljava lang string

after learning how to properly access the fields and properties of a list with mono cecil it was pointed out that you need to make sure that the context of the type arguments is maintained on the list object that you re working with which makes sense
what s the proper way to do this
edit based on simon s request given you have a typereference for a list for example and you want to access it s fields you ll actually need a typedefinition for this list
when you attempt to resolve your typereference you end up losing the type arguments that were a part of the original typereference aka your new typedefinition will now be for which will have a genericparameter of t
i have attempted to re apply the type arguments via code like the following this doesn t work leading to an error
if you didn t attempt to repopulate in this fashion the error would instead be member t is declared
yes absolutely
i do this in java should be fairly simple to do in javascript too
first you ll need to break the colors up into rgb components
then calculate the differences between start and finish of the components
finally calculate percentage difference and multiply by the start color of each component then add it to the start color
assuming you can get the rgb values this should do it the percentfade is a floating decimal signifying how far to fade into the endcolor
1 would be a full fade thus creating the end color
0 would be no fade the starting color
no special syntax

it is a jit compiler issue
if i disable the jit compiler i get these results the strange slowdown dissapears once the jit compiler is deactivated
as for why the jit compiler causes such behaviour
that is beyond my skill and knowledge
but it does not happen in all jvms as marius dornean s tests show
the real problem here is that the parser looks into nested elements in spite of the specified tag
the params field if present would always be tagged with 1 in the encoding
for untagged fields it does make sense to look into the nested types for tags
just add the gzipcontentencodingfilter to your jersey app see that will automatically compress it using gzip if the client supports it which it figures out from the accept encoding http header
as mentioned in the docs when defining a many to many relationship from a model to itself using an intermediary model you must use see the model field reference
thus it is not yet
possible to have a symmetrical recursive many to many relationship with extra fields in django
it s a pick two sorta deal
few issues 1 should be use for string comparison
same applies for other string comparisons you have in code
2 for int comparison not same applies for other places in your code

i am attempting to create an application which consists of one activity where the user selects an image a second activity which contains a custom view which takes that image and renders it to a canvas
all of this works perfectly running on my phone however android studio is complaining about a nullpointerexception when attempting to view the xml in design mode
it produces the following stack trace here is the relevant code in the first activity and then in the custom view and the view xml i have a feeling it s to do with how i am passing the bitmap between the activity and its subview but i haven t got the foggiest on how to solve this problem
google isn t turning up anything since i can t find another person who has code that will compile but that android studio doesn t like for whatever reason
is this a problem with me or with android studio
sidenote if some of the code looks strangely drawn out that s me attempting to debug it
i d appreciate any help anyone can offer
apologies if this question is too basic or i ve not provided enough detail my first time here
this seems to be a stupid question since java does short circuit but i remembered how android doesn t quite use java in the same sense as i assume so say in this bit of code i wrote would it be better for me to put the more common things zip rar before the less common things tarballs gzip
the fact that i wasn t able to find a similar question on so probably gives me the answer to this but better safe than sorry
you could do it several ways many of which are documented here already
here is the approach i typically take have the test case inherit from the concrete class
hope that helps

why do you want to call another shell script when you can do it in one
i m trying to stream data using tcp from a client to a server
my client application is generating data every tick
the data is buffered for transfer and every 500ms the whole buffer is sent to the server
so far so good
the data i m getting from the client is valid and the throughput is high around 30kb s
after about a minute though the throughput quickly drops to zero
if i wait for awhile sometimes the throughput increases again but eventually drops back to zero
i m generating data every tick so if the receiving end slows down there s more data to receive than usual which takes longer to receive and so on
the maximum send buffer i can use on the client a phone device is 2 17 bytes and rtt time is around 50ms
if i continuously ping another computer on the lan rtt rockets up as the throughput drops
terminating my server causes the rtt to return to steady state immediately
any idea what s causing this
setter value used in your style only support some hardcoded classes staticresource dynamicresource and bindingbase because providing of a value has to be deferred to the point when styles are applied and it seems they had not enough time to implement it properly so they check for the supported classes and apply them later
just add this line at the end of your loop that s just shorthand for saying if i is equal to 3 set it back to zero else leave it as it is
that should kick off your loop all over again until you set an exit condition
edit hold on i didn t actually look at how you appended the sorry can t get jsfiddle to run anything at the moment
if you were to use the i reset as above you d really need to set the number of
characters equal to i with every iteration
edit 2 looking again you d even need to take i into a closure to get its value at the time the settimeout is declared otherwise you ll get whatever value it is when settimeout is executed which is unpredictable

background information i ve recently upgraded from lion to mountainlion and the newest xcode
the app im working on has deployment target 10 7
problem i ve a nsbutton setup in the interfacebuilder with title start and alternate stop
in the buttons ibaction i check the state of the application bool isrunning and change the state every time the button is pressed like this everything worked fine
since i upgraded to the new xcode the button does not change the title anymore
things i already tried out checked all the connections between ibaction and iboutlet according this button
reset everything up
did not help
created a new nsbutton tried the same
did not work
setting the titles via code did not work
thought it may have been a problem with the boolean value
so i checked if the button is not in mixed mode
then hardcoded statechanges with 1 and 0 from type int
no change at all
somehow when i use startstopbutton settitle test and then change the state it changes the state once to alternate but not back anymore
the test string is never seen on the button also
i logged the value of appdelegate datacontroller appisrunning and it returns the correct values
i have no clue how to solve this
everything worked fine i changed nothing and it doesn t make any sense to me

i need to get the log for specific directory in svn database non recursively

first off i want to say i know there are easy ways around this issue but just by googleing and looking on stackoverflow it doesn t seem like there is a set way you are suppose to go about doing this so i wanted to see if anyone out there had ran into this before and came out with a nice solution
here is my issue i want to add an additional property for each property in an object
this works fine in newer ies and in firefox but will cause an infinite loop in ie8
is there a way to do this without having to create a variable that holds the original value of oobject just to add an additional property for each property in oobject
note for those jquery fans out there each has the same issue
also i wish i could just not support ie8
update jsfiddle additional information i actually haven t tested this in a true ie browser i have been using the developer tools from ie10 and selecting ie8 for browser mode and ie 8 standards for document mode
this may make some kind of difference i am not sure

most of my programming prior to python was in c or matlab
i don t have a degree in cs almost completed a phd in physics but have done some courses and a good amount of actual programming
now i m taking an algorithms course on coursera excellent course by the way with a professor from stanford
i decided to implement the homeworks in python
however sometimes i find myself wanting things the language does not so easily support
i m very used to creating classes and objects for things in c just to group together data i e
when there are no methods
in python however where you can add fields on the fly what i basically end up wanting all the time are matlab structs
i think this is possibly a sign i am not using good style and doing things the pythonic way
underneath is my implementation of a union find data structure for kruskal s algorithm
although the implementation is relatively short and works well there isn t much error checking there are a few odd points

however if a list of explicit pieces of data are passed in instead i e
a list of ints the code fails
is there some much clearer more pythonic way to implement this
i have tried to google this but most examples are very simple and relate more to procedural code i e
the proper way to do a for loop in python
if you bring up the developer tools in chrome tools developer tools there s an audits tab that you can use to do a quick check of your page there should be a reload page and audit on load option to check before you click on run
it will give you some suggestions as to issues it finds on your page
there are other more extensive ways to check but this is a very quick audit you can perform
note that jquery handles the correct index value in this example
an even tighter script would read

understanding where clause is straightforward
you will see in many sources that people complain about its misleading name
the better name to use is slicer
by using a where clause you are able to query a slice of a cube instead of the whole cube obviously you will have some performance gains when you query a slice instead of a whole cube
from clause is used to query a cube or to query another mdx query i e
subqueries
subqueries are generally slower but are more powerful too
e g
when you use a hierarchy as a slicer you cannot use it in an axis while with a subquery you can e g
subqueries can change the hierarchies structure
in the above statement you see nested subqueries
if you know some mdx syntax it is easy to break and interpret each subquery or even move some to the slicer
i am relatively new to the whole olap subject too
the two sources i have been using are iccube mdx reference i am not a microsoft fan iccube was a good easy to use alternative and fast track to mdx
i specially like fast track to mdx because its explanation of essential mdx features and the terminology like set tuple function etc is easy to follow specially if you are using microsoft bi tools

i generated with admin generator this how can i make add for this clause where id 10 for list in index
maybe in generator yml
not python why would you want a lib anyway
but
you can do recall that map in python 3 is a generator
for python 2 you probably want to use imap mea culpa after timing these the method i offered is hands down the slowest the fastest is or which is just a silly itertools variant
use jack aidleys solution
timing code results
i don t think that you can classify a matrix with half zeros as sparse the timing you have found are reasonable actually the sparse algorithm is behaving pretty well
sparse algorithms are efficient only when considering matrices where most of the elements are zeros for example matrices coming out from finite elements problems
this holds true for cpus non only for gpus there s an important overhead in treating the matrix as sparse and it become convenient to use sparse algorithms only when
most of the elements are zeros typical ten or less non zeros per row matrix of rank thousands hundred thousands millions
there are other matrix shapes that have efficient solution algorithms that you can try if it applies to your problem e g
band matrices
i don t know whether they have been ported to cublas though
about the overheads dense linear algebra algorithms can perform optimally because processors have been designed in order to best efficiently solve for such systems
consider the dgemm operation matrix matrix multiply it s an operation that let you use the processors at 95 of it s theoretical peak floating point performance for large matrices ie matrices not fitting any cache of the system
how
prefetching optimal cache usage vectorization sse avx pipelining in a sparse la algorithm only non zero elements and their corresponding indexes are stored into memory memory accesses are in fact indirect
so the sparse algorithm cannot exploit the hardware at the same level of optimization i don t know about specific figures in this context but 10 to 20 wouldn t be strange
the gain is clearly that operations on zeros on non stored elements are simply not performed resulting in order of magnitudes less operations and much less needed storage
there are further overheads in integers logics conditionals but modern cpus are pretty good in overlapping integer and fp operations and with speculative executions
unfortunately they too can prevent vectorization and so are further overheads with respect to the dense case
what about gpus
dense la algorithm are an optimal fit for gpus as the same as for cpus in this case you have optimal usage of coalescing shared memory memory access patterns again the indirect access to matrices elements in sparse la algorithm prevent to exploit the same level of optimization
references i can t remember which one i used when encountered sparse problems
i think it was psblas but here you will be overwhelmed of them

you can use something like values length where values is your string array
i ve never used that library but if i understand you correctly your disk file is locking because you are reading it so no other application can read it is that correct
in this case it s not your app that s become multi threaded and you shouldn t need locks within your application
you do however have to make sure that the file is opened for read only puroposes allowing readonly access to other applications

if anyone ever faces this issue here s how i resolved it ideally for the encoding issue this should ve worked but in the set of webpages i was scrubbing there were a few pages which didn t store any value in href variable resulting in a few nonetype returns
and that was failing the statement
so i finally did this if href is a nonetype its best to assign it to an empty string to prevent any type specific issue further in the code
one of the observations i ve made about the u 2018 and u 2019 characters is that more often than not they don t occur in the link itself but in the attribute attached to the links

i am using odp net to run the aggregate avg against an oracle 10g database
i run this query directly on the database and it works fine select avg anschaffungskst from ihobjekt it returns 13 4493973163521 niether the hql nor the createcriteria interfaces successfully execute the query
i recieve an nhibernate could not execute query message
however i am relatively certain it is an odp net error based on this posting
there is a solution for oracle simply trunc the avg
however the trunc command is different in oracle versus sql server and i need want to keep my code from being database specific
any ideas about how i can reduce the number of decimal points so it fits within a decimal and most importantly it works on all databases

to quote from the msdn documentation a semicolon separated list of strings used to vary the output cache
by default these strings correspond to a query string value sent with get method attributes or a parameter sent using the post method
when this attribute is set to multiple parameters the output cache contains a different version of the requested document for each combination of specified parameters
possible values include none an asterisk and any valid query string or post parameter name
so if you set it to a
b then these urls will be cached separately but those urls will access the same cache entry

i m using ado for my databases
i also use a version number scheme but only as a sanity check
i have a program i developed which uses the connection gettablenames and connection getfieldnames to identify any discrepancy against an xml document which describes the master database
if there is a discrepancy then i build the appropriate sql to create the missing fields
i never drop additional ones
i then have a dbpatch table which contains a list of patches identified by a unique name
if there are specific patches missing then they are applied and the appropriate record is added to the dbpatch table
most often this is new stored procs or field resizing or indexes i also maintain a min db version which is also checked since i allow users to use an older version of the client i only allow them to use a version that is min db version and lt

i have a bit of a conundrum
i am using bootstrap on a wordpress site locally and i m experiencing a weird effect in what i thought would be a simple slidetoggle event
fyi it only happens on mobile devices and i am not using bootstrap s js file just css
i have a list of lis and inside a few is a ul with its respective lis
the nested ul has a display of none and when its parent li is clicked an event is triggered slidetoggle
on a regular desktop it works fine both on large display port and mobile emulators
but on any mobile device the slidetoggle event only happens once
i click it opens i click again it closes i click again and nothing happens
but if i throw an alert inside the click event the alert always fires even though the ul does not
i have tried different selectors adding a stop propagation event and nothing seems to fix this
of course in my example below it is working fine
also note that if i disable bootstrap s css it then works fine on all platforms
but i don t see bootstrap adding any additional classes to the lis or nested uls

look into using the hipi library it stores a collection of images into an imagebundle which is more efficient that storing the individual image files in hdfs
they have a couple of examples too
as for your code you need to specify what input and output formats you plan to use
there is no current input format that hands the entire file over but you can just extend fileinputformat and create a recordreader that emits pairs where the key is the filename and the value is the bytes of the image file
in fact hadoop the definitive guide has an example of this exact input format
i m dealing with currencies and i want to round down the number to 2 decimal places
even if the number is 500 0 i would like it to be 500 00 to be consistent
when i do 500 00 to_d it converts it to 500 0
whats a good way of changing this behavior
i also use this method to round down to 2 digits and make sure it always has 2 decimals
you have two choices use php to split the field into an array and work through that use multiple rows where season only holds one value using php you could use and then use a foreach statement to iterate through season the problem you have is that php interprets 2 3 as a string
when it s converted into a number it appears as 2 try using multiple rows for the season field this will also help where you want to select all rows finally as tobias said don t use the mysql_ functions
use newer functions which are supported

try like so your example just works once because every time you execute the function top and left properties are reset to 0
also it s better to create an outer reference to the iframe element so it s not necessary recreating a new one at each function call

is there any way by which we can get the video aspect ration from video view or actual video height and width
you can try it will give you the corresponding properties then you can add your logic like
if column isgood has 99 000 n values and 1 000 y values and you run with the condition then it may be appropriate to use an index to find the results you are returning 1 of the rows
if you run the query with the condition a full table scan would be more appropriate since you are returning most of the table anyway
if you were to use an index for the n condition you would be doing an extra index lookup for every data item lookup
although the general rule is that bind parameters are good it can be problematic in this kind of instance if really two different plans are required for the query
with the bind parameter scenario the statement will be parsed and a plan computed and saved in the sql cache
the same plan will be used for both query scenarios which is not desirable
but will result in two plans being stored in the sql cache hopefully each with the appropriate plan for the query
version 11g avoids this problem with adaptive cursor sharing which can use different plans for different bind variable values
you need to look at your plans explain plan to see what is happening in your case
flush the cache try one method examine the plan
try the other examine the plan
it might give you an idea what is happening in your case
there are a bunch of other topics you might follow up on that may help for example using a hint to force the use of an index cursor_sharing parameter histograms on statistics
it tells me that the method s return type is void yes that s how most callbacks are defined
there is often no need to return you instead act on the result
i want to return the jsonobject response variable from the onresponse method to the parent postrequest method again there s no need to return anything if you restructure the call
plus there was no return statement at the end of the method so your code wasn t completely correct to start
use volley to your advantage and pass around its listener objects in order to return things
sidenote this doesn t shouldn t be an activity class
if you need a context make a constructor
then to use now as you can see there s really not much difference between this approach and just making the volley request directly
all you ve done is expose the parameters and hide the url requestqueue and error listener behind another class
i might even suggest using a builder pattern approach for the parameters because certainly each request uses different parameters
and now you get to collapse the setter with the execution
i need to find the combinations in a list of lists

i would like to convert a python date object to a unix timestamp
i already added a time object so it would be that specific date at midnight but i don t know how to continue from there
i am using python 2 7
im with a problem here and i can t solve it i have a cell with today s date and 2 columns the first one with a range date 20 mar 15 for example the second one with a specific date that may not be defined yet in this case the cell will remain blank that being said i want to make the cells in the first column change the colors as the range date is aproaching like green if 30 days ahead yellow if 15 days red if 5 days
but only if the second column remains blank
if there is a specific date in the second column i dont want the first one to change the colors
in the formatting rule i tried using this if isblank aq 13 ap13 e 7lt
5 false if the second one aq13 is blank the function would return the date comparison if not would return false can someone help me

i would change the schema of your table
first table is category with columns second table is question with columns third table is options with columns the relation of question table with the category table is the cat_id
then the relation of question table to options table is question_id
you ll be storing your multiple options in the options table
what if suddenly you want to have more options for a question
then this schema would work for you
then for the correct column 1 would trigger a correct answer and 0 for wrong one
for example category table question table options table so when you fetch a question you can use inner join to get the options answer or filter it with category
this is probably a lark but for the recaptcha control as it sometimes takes a long time to render is this possible
if it takes more than say 5 seconds to render i d like to stop the rendering of the object and display my own captcha
i d start a timer on page load and if 5 seconds has elapsed in some event in the recaptcha control prerender
i d cancel the render or make it invisible or something to that effect
it is a 3rd party user control so i don t have the source
update i tried the code below after i posted
it sort of works in that if the user control can t connect its server ie i turn disconnect my internet connection but it doesn t sense when there is a really long pause when the control has waiting for the server to get back to it
even if i change the millisecond interval to 1 the control renders

the cause of the problem is that you are getting an exception thrown probably that httpexception near the end of your code and yii wants to construct a cexceptionevent instance so that it can raise the capplication onexception event
however yii s class autoloader has been removed from the autoload stack and as a result php cannot find the class
try commenting out the code that removes and adds yii s autoloader and see if it makes a difference you can also call spl_autoload_functions to check what exactly is going on with your spl_autoload stack maybe something has corrupted it
superjoe30 writes related question perhaps answers can be edited to answer this question as well what about using source control on your own computer if you re the sole programmer

how to insert user_id user_name user_type with vestal versions into the versions table
the reason that is never true in your given code is because you call global key after the condition check
the variable isn t in scope until it s been registered with global
to fix this simply move the line to above the so you function will look like this will work fine when passed an array even if said array is _post or _get
the order you pass in the arrays will matter though
if an index key is defined in _post and also in _get and you pass _post to the function first the value from _get will not be stored into the variable
alternatively if you want to shy away from using variable variables either for readability issues or simple preference you can use the globals superglobal in the same way with this method the variables are still accessible as if they were defined normally
for example this example is suitable for both code samples above
extra alternatively you can use php s function
it s purpose is to do exactly what you re method does and even has a flag to overwrite existing variable values
example usage a warning regarding which directly applies to this situation comes from the php website do not use extract on untrusted data like user input i e
_get _files etc
if you do for example if you want to run old code that relies on register_globals temporarily make sure you use one of the non overwriting extract_type values such as extr_skip and be aware that you should extract in the same order that s defined in variables_order within the php ini

ie will see the box as 560px 20px left padding 20px right padding to equal 600 rather than 600px 20px left padding 20px right padding as browsers should see it
the default behaviour of the box model is to take the width of the box and then add padding and margins to it
the best way to target ie6 is to use a conditional comment and then in that stylesheet set the box as width 560px
i m assuming you don t have margins but if you do you need to subtract those from the overall width too

i thought that passing in the security context service and doing the code below would do it but it doesn t work it just says that security_context is not an object

i have a postgres driven application which rounds quantities to the next not nearest 4th decimal place
so 0 00341 becomes 0 0035
in implementing it i came upon a situation where 0 0012 even is being rounded up to 0 0013 even though it shouldn t
it s 0 0012 even
in fact even agrees at first glance we know that there is no arbitrary precision introduced yet when the figure 0 0012 is arrived at by way of a computation the situation changes it would appear that the computed 0 0012 is greater than actual 0 0012 predictably this leads the rounding mechanism to round 0 0012 up to 0 0013 which is obviously wrong if the expression evaluates to 0 0012 even so clearly i m missing something here about how the expression is evaluated and or how the data types involved are cast
there s additional precision introduced that shouldn t be there
any help would be appreciated

i think the formula could be improved as this relies on dates being in order
the following will preserve the count for any order that is sorted assume essentially enter b2 and c2 formulae and drag down
you might need to swap ddmmyyyy to mmddyyyy as we use dates first rather than months also note the locking of the first part of the range only using a 1 ax this works perfectly for your current question but does not work if the issue count is assigned in time order per date
and your error is caused by java lang instantiationexception
solution is
this doesn t make any sense at all
that is not how you access two elements of an array
you re combining two strings with yielding boolean true and attempting to access row true
you can t access an array that way
if you want to use both items you need to access them individually if you want to build a query string containing these two values you should use which will take care of url encoding your data note that if you actually just select the fields you need you don t have to explicitly specify them in the arguments to if your row already contains only mf_id and manufacturer it would be enough to use
imagine i have a number of objects represented as balls in a gravity simulation they re clumped together in 3 groups for example but it could be any number how can give each object value depending on which group 1 2 3 it s in
i only got this far i can t figure it out
the thing is two balls in the same group might not necessarily be touching because there may a another ball in between them but all balls in a group touch at least one other ball in the group
the value would just be something like this group 1

if you have complicated xml i would suggest using defined objects
it makes things easier in the long run
for your example and then your code to call it would turn into then you can access the values directly from your dtobjektinfo object
makes coding a lot easier with large xml files as all the work is done in the linq query and then you have a final object
the benefits of this is that you only have to get the linq right once
coding will be aided by the fact that you are now working with an object whose properties are known and intellisense yay
all the elements can be cast to the correct types or exceptions thrown
saving a lot of issues later

whilst i m a little late to this party i think it s definitely worth mentioning dart which is a google product and typescript which is a microsoft product
javascript is fast becoming an extremely popular language as applications become more web based
however as you have pointed out javascript lacks type safety and to name a few other things
classes interfaces and packages namespaces modules
this is where dart and typescript step in
these languages are essentially supersets of javascript
when you write dart or typescript code it is compiled into clean standards compliant javascript
the benefits of dart and typescript are that they provide type safety interfaces classes etc
thus allowing you to write cleaner scalable manageable applications which still run in the browser
being a microsoft oriented programmer i ve had a lot of experience with typescript including being somewhat active in the development of the language you can find information for typescript development at codeplex my only concern at the moment is that typescript is lacking in some fundamental features
it seems that some of the current implementation 0 9 0 alpha has some equally gaping holes that might deter the savvy developer from using it at the moment subject to change of course
i cannot really comment on dart as i have only used this a few times but my overall experience with dart was good

mind you at the time of posting this release is not super stable so might want to wait for the final release build

if the user navigates away from the page while there is an ongoing ajax call there is nothing you could do to prevent it from stopping it
the best you could do is to subscribe for the onbeforeunload event and tell the user that there is an ongoing ajax call and that if he continues he might lose his data of course you will initialize this handler only before sending an ajax request and remove it when this request succeeds
